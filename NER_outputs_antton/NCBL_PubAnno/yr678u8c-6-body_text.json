The pathway allows a cell to degrade long - lived proteins , aggregated proteins and organelles during periods of starvation to provide nutrients for continued cellular processes , as well as playing an important role in cellular homeostasis , ageing and development [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] . In addition , dysregulation of autophagy plays an important role in the development of some cancers [ 16 ] . During autophagy , regions of the cytoplasm become engulfed into double membrane bound vesicles termed autophagosomes . These vesicles then fuse with late endosomes / lysosomes , where the contents are degraded by lysosomal proteases ( Figure 2 ) . For detailed reviews of autophagy signaling , see [ 17 , 18 ] . The major control complex for autophagy is MTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) which , when active , inhibits initiation of the pathway . MTOR senses amino acid levels , as well as levels of growth factors and glucose and genotoxic and ER stress . Under resting conditions , MTOR phosphorylates and inactivates the ULK complex , comprising unc - 51 - like kinase 1 / 2 ( ULK1 / 2 ) , focal adhesion kinase family - interacting protein of 200 kDa ( FIP200 ) and mammalian ATG13 . Under stimulatory conditions , MTOR is inactivated ; the ULK complex becomes hypophosphorylated and relocates to the site of formation of the autophagosome , the phagophore . Formation of the autophagosome proceeds by addition of new membrane to the phagophore , as opposed to budding from an existing membrane , in a poorly understood process . However , a number of proteins are known to be required . Recruitment of these proteins occurs via the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) by the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase complex ( PI3K ) , including BECN1 ( Beclin 1 ) . Inhibition of PI3K activity using drugs such as wortmannin and 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - MA ) , and sequestration of BECN1 by antiapoptotic protein B - cell lymphoma / leukemia - 2 ( Bcl2 ) all inhibit autophagy .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 461}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
