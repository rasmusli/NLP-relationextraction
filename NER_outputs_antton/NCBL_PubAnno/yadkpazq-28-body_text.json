This cell line has previously indicated less sensitivity to the antiviral effects of type I IFN [ 66 ] and generally 10 - fold higher amounts of rfeIFN\u03b1 were found in titration experiments to be required for the inhibition of all five viruses . Concordantly , average fold viral inhibition in CrFK cells by the Sup 2216 was approximately half that observed in fcwf - 4 cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
