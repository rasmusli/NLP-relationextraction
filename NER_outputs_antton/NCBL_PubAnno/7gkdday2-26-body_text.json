On the other hand , the rates of coinfections of predominantly detected respiratory viral pathogens including HRV , RSV , HMPV , HPIV - 3 , HBoV , and adenovirus were 63 . 5 % , 52 % , 42 % , 71 % , 50 % and 93 % , respectively . In 72 coinfected cases , 52 showed a pair - wise fashion of co - occurrences of pathogens , whereas 18 showed pathogen co - occurrences in a tri - partner manner . In two cases , up to four pathogens were detected in each specimen . Interestingly , coinfection partners of adenovirus were mostly confined to viruses including 5 RSV , 4 HRV , 3HPIV - 3 , 1 influenza A , 1 HMPV , 1 HBoV , whereas there was only one co - detection of bacterial isolates ( E . agglomerans ) with adenovirus ( Table 4 ) . Among 16 parainfluenza coinfection cases , 15 were HPIV - 3 and 1 was HPIV - 1 . Although major HPIV - 3 coinfection partners included HRV , RSV , adenovirus , S . pneumoniae and K . pneumoniae , one HPIV - 1 case was co - detected with RSV and HBoV . On the other hand , 5 out of 11 HMPV coinfection partners included bacteria like S . pneumoniae ( two ) , K . pneumoniae ( one ) , and one Streptococcus species as well as viral pathogens including HRV ( five ) , HPIV - 3 , HBoV and adenovirus .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 899, "end": 910}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 947}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
