To specifically target an etiology , we have created monoclonal antibodies with pairing of the heavy and light chains utilizing the 10x Genomics \u00ae Single Cell sequencing technology [ 150 ] . As an example , from the PB rise of near 11 % of circulating B cells seen in subject 24 , we created a panel of 946 paired heavy and light chain sequences . From this sample , there are a number of clones with exact sequence repeats ( roughly 5 % ) . To assign clonal groups , we analyzed the sequences using CDR3 length and sequences , and compared predicted germline antibody sequences ( from IMGT , [ 151 ] ) . Roughly 40 % of clones can be assigned to have clonal relationships . Several of the monoclonal antibodies we generated are presented in Table 2 . We chose these fifteen antibodies to highlight markers that show somatic hypermutation and clonal expansion . These are highlighted by predicted clonal members , isotype switching , nucleotide substitutions from predicted germlines , and increases in the subgroup replacement to silent nucleotide mutation ( R / S ) ratios . Elevation of this ratio supports clonal selection of affinity matured antibodies which would correlate with an increase in mutations leading to changes in the amino acids , particularly in the antigen binding complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ) [ 152 ] . Work on identifying the protein targets of these antibodies is ongoing . Because of the characteristics seen in these antibodies , we hypothesize these antibodies target the etiology that caused KD in this child .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1668, "end": 1671}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
