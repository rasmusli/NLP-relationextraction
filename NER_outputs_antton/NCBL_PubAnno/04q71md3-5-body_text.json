Using weekly time series of excess mortality due to pneumonia and influenza ( P & I ) , Viboud et al . [ 9 ] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence of outbreaks across the continental USA are most strongly associated with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces , and to a lesser extent with the distance between locations and various measures of domestic transportation . In contrast , Brownstein et al . [ 10 ] concluded that the rate of inter - regional spread and timing of influenza in the USA , as measured using weekly P & I mortality statistics , is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November . These discordant findings generated significant debate [ 11 ] , especially in the context of a potential pandemic of pathogenic influenza [ 12 ] , which would require rapid decisions to be made on the implementation of travel restrictions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 275}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 346}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 360}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 795, "end": 805}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
