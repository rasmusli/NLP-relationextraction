We have demonstrated that G0 / G1 synchronization promotes EV - D68 viral replication ( Figures 1A - D ) . However , in our previous study , we determined that G0 / G1 synchronization inhibits EV - A71 viral replication . To exclude experimental variation as an explanation for the disparate responses of these viruses to G0 / G1 synchronization , we performed a side - by - side comparison of the two enteroviruses . Our results confirm that no serum treatment induces G0 / G1 synchronization ( Figures 5A , B ) and G0 / G1 synchronization has opposite effects for the two viruses ( Figure 5 ) . After 18 h infection with EV - D68 , the viral genomic mRNA level was 13 . 55 times higher in serum - starved cells than in control cells ( P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 5C ) ; however , after 18 h infection with EV - A71 , the viral genomic mRNA level was 3 . 12 times lower in serum - starved cells ( P < 0 . 05 ; Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , after 24 h infection , the TCID50 / mL for EVD68 was 341 . 66 times higher for G0 / G1 phase - synchronized cells The results were standardized using GAPDH mRNA as a control and normalized to 1 . 0 in mock - infected cells . ( E , F ) At 24 h post - infection , The TCID50 / mL was shown through titrating the progeny viruses of EV - D68 or EV - A71 in the supernatants with RD cells .

These results confirm that G0 / G1 - phase arrest has different effects for the two enteroviruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 505}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
