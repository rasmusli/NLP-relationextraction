Silenced cells were challenged with replication competent NL4 - 3 and viral replication was monitored through the accumulation of exo - RT in the culture supernatants at different days post infection . Under these conditions , viral replication was increased by IFITMs silencing in both IFN - stimulated and unstimulated conditions over control silenced cells , indicating that IFITMs may provide already a basal level of resistance even in non stimulated Jurkat T cells . Given that in addition to the direct decrease in viral particles infectivity that we describe here , IFITMs have been previously described to affect the entry of HIV - 1 when expressed in target cells [ 9 ] and given that the assay of spreading infection does not allow the distinction between these two effects , viral particles retrieved at the end of the culture were normalized by exo - RT activity and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells to determine their intrinsic infectivity in a single round infection assay ( Figure 5D ) . Under these conditions , the infectivity of viral particles produced in IFITM - knockdown cells was higher than the one of viruses produced in control cells and this increase was of 1 , 6 fold in unstimulated Jurkat cells , but reached 5 fold in IFN - stimulated cells , suggesting again that IFITMs do play an antiviral role in Jurkat cells that is exacerbated upon IFN stimulation . Of note , we have already determined that IFN\u03b1 does not influence the early phases of infection in HeLa cells [ 43 ] , so that its presence is unlikely to be a confounding factor in the determination of the infectivity of viral particles in this cell type . Overall , these results further strengthen the notion that IFITMs negatively interfere with the infectivity of HIV - 1 viral particles and do so in different cell types in which they are naturally expressed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
