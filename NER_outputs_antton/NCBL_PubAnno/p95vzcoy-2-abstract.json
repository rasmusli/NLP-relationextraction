Deformed wing virus ( DWV ) , an RNA virus described from honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) , has been shown to have a broad host range . Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees , foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur . However , the role of the ant Myrmica rubra as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet . Here , we show with a 16 - week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type - A and - B to infect M . rubra and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir . However , the titers of both plus - and minus - sense viral RNA strands decreased over time . Since the ants were fed with highly virus - saturated honeybee pupae , this probably resulted in initial viral peaks , then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later . Since DWV infections were also found in untreated field - collected M . rubra colonies , our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism . of honeybee viruses frequently happens , although it is not fully understood why and when pathogens jump between some species and not others [ 4 , 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
