The low rate of asymptomatic infection in Korea is attributable to the different transmission pathway of MERS infections compared to the Middle East . In Korea , most of the MERS cases were healthcare - associated infections , and none were from an animal . The low asymptomatic infection rate is also attributable to the extensive epidemiological investigation conducted in Korea , including close monitoring of contacts with MERS patients ; this helped identify almost all MERS patients . This may also have been attributable to the promotion of proactive identification of patients via mass media and the establishment of communication networks by the government , leading to voluntary reports by people , active quarantine , and countermeasures to this public health crisis [ 10 , 28 , 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 109}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 192}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 353}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 411}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 664}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 712}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
