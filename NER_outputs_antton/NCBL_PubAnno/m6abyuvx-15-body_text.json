To determine whether CD4 or CD8 T - cell activity was required for the reduction in HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice , we analyzed the core protein levels in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice immunized with rVV - N25 in the absence of CD4 or CD8 T cells ( Figure 4A ) . As expected , the mice lacking CD4 or CD8 T cells failed to show a reduction in HCV core protein levels ( Figure 4B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
