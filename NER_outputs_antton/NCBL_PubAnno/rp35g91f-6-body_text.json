Systems - genetics approaches use genetic reference populations such as the BXD resource , a set of recombinant inbred mice which are the progeny of an intercross between the two parental mouse strains C57BL / 6J and DBA / 2J ( Andreux et al . 2012 ; Peirce et al . 2004 ) . Recombinant inbred strains like the BXD and the Collaborative Cross ( Ram et al . 2014 ; Threadgill et al . 2011 ) are especially suited for systems - genetics studies because each strain is effectively immortal ( Andreux et al . 2012 ) . They provide a powerful test bed for linking genetic loci to variation , including mapping loci controlling gene expression levels . Such loci are termed expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) ( Chesler et al . 2005 ) . Importantly , analyses of eQTL provide a means for detecting specific regulators of a gene of interest as well as identification of networks of coregulated transcripts ( Andreux et al . 2012 ; Hall et al . 2014 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
