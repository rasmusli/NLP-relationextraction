Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of the Fc neonatal receptor ( FcRn ) in human genital mucosal tissue [ 19 ] . FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor belonging to the MHC class I family of proteins [ 20 , 21 ] . The expression of FcRn in endothelial cells is thought to be critical for IgG homeostasis in blood [ 22 ] , and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transporting maternal IgG to the fetal circulation [ 23 ] . A characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the Fc region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [ 24 ] . This pH - dependent binding allows the transport of intact IgG or of IgG immune complexes from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids , for example , cervicovaginal secretions , to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 48}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
