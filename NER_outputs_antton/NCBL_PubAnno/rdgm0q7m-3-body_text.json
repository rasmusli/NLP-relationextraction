First described as the mechanism by which the Gag - Pol polyprotein of the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) is expressed from overlapping gag and pol ORFs ( 4 ) , related \u2212 1 PRF signals have been documented in many other viruses of clinical , veterinary and agricultural importance ( reviewed in Ref . 5 ) . PRF has also been increasingly recognized in conventional cellular genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in other replicating elements , such as insertion sequences and transposons ( 6 , 7 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 434}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
