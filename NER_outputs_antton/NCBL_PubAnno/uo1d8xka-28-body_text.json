They distinguish between the workload distribution by a parallel component to multiple compute nodes and the communication between two of more servers exchanging data , respectively . Serverserver communication uses raw sockets to transfer data from one machine to the other . This solution provides a performance benefit over more sophisticated alternatives such as RMI or CORBA , but represents the lowest level of abstraction of the underlying network . As an answer to this trade - off , MP 2 overcomes the limitations of development complexity and inflexibility by providing an abstraction at the component level supported by a fixed number of network level operations . Thus , a developer has a high degree of flexibility regarding the operation of a component as long as the implementation adheres to the I / O scheme provided by the communication layer . Implicit communication refers to the communication that takes place between the output of one component and the input of another component , i . e . the selected data paths among components . The underlying transfer mechanism is provided by the middleware and comprises input buffers in order to enable asynchronous communication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
