Figure 6 shows that 3D8 scFv did not hydrolyze methylated or histone - bound DNA when the activity of 3D8 scFv was , 1 . 4610 24 U / ml . This result indicates that chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated and histone - bound . , 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 cells are expressed at lower working concentrations than we tested in our in vitro analysis shown in Figure 6 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
