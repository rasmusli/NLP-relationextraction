The essential oils of diverse Pimpinella species and their isolates were able to inhibit NF - kB transcription induced by phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) in SW1353 cells . However , they did not present similar activities . The most remarkable activity was reported for three Pimpinella species and five pure compounds : Pimpinella corymbosa Boiss . , Pimpinella tragium Vill . ssp . polyclada ( Boiss . et Heldr . Tutin ) , Pimpinella rhodanta Boiss . oils and 4 - ( 2 - propenyl ) phenylangelate , 4 - ( 3 - methyloxiranyl ) phenyltiglate , 4 - methoxy - 2 - ( 3 - methyloxiranyl ) phenyl isobutyrate , 4 - methoxy - 2 - ( 3 - methyloxiranyl ) phenylangelate and epoxypseudoisoeugenol - 2 - methylbutyrate [ 146 ] . These results also indicated the importance of a common structure ( epoxyphenylpropanoid moiety ) present in some of these pure compounds for the best anti - inflammatory activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
