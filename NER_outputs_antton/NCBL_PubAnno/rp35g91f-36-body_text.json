These genes were considered to be part of a pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network . This extended gene network contained a number of transcription factors ( Tbx5 , Hand2 , Fhl2 , and Gata4 ) and ion / calcium handling genes ( Ank2 , Cacna2d2 , Scn5a , Kcnd2 , Kcnj5 , Myoz2 , Casq2 , Csrp3 , and Gja3 ) of interest in the context of atrial fibrillation . We used this pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network to investigate enriched GO terms , signaling pathways , and human phenotypes related to the coexpression of these genes in the lung using WebGestalt . The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was significantly enriched with GO terms involving biological processes related to both striated and cardiac muscle function and development ( Table 5 ) . Enriched molecular functions included cytoskeletal protein binding and cation transmembrane transporter activity ( Table 5 ) , and enriched cellular components included contractile fiber and sarcomeric genes ( Table 5 ) . Collectively , these data support our approach for identifying genes that are likely to be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium , as our coexpressed genes are indeed enriched for cardiac muscle function .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 438}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
