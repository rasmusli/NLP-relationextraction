The authors developed a novel method for systemic delivery of antiviral siRNAs into T cells in mice : they used an antibody to the CD7 receptor as their delivery system by receptor - mediated endocytosis . They bound the siRNA to the antibody through the positively charged nona - D - arginine ( 9R ) peptide conjugated to its C - terminal via a disulfide bond . They successfully suppressed HIV - 1 infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of these siRNA complexes , inhibiting HIV - 1 entry into target cells and its replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
