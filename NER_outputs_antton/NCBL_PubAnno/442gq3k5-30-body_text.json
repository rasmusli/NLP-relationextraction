In contrast , 6 / 101 ( 6 % ) of patients had PCR positive swab samples , a rate similar to what was found in slaughterhouse workers in Germany [ 16 ] . Eating pig intestines in the few days prior to admission was reported in 3 / 6 of the patients with a PCR positive throat or rectal swab , two of which were also culture positive . Taken together , rather than indicating human carriage of S . suis serotype 2 , our results strengthen the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract may be a route of entry for at least a proportion of patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 122}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
