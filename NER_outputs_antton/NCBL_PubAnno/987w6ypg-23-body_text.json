We first used HeLaP4 cells that express IFITMs at steady state . HeLa cells were challenged with miR30 - shRNAs specific for the 3 IFITMs or control target sequences ( luciferase ) , and shortly selected with puromycin . Then , cells were challenged with replication competent HIV - 1 ( NL4 - 3 at an MOI 1 ) to obtain a consistent amount of virus - producing cells . After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment to remove non internalized virus , cells were re - seeded and two days after , cells were lysed and newly produced viral particles were purified , normalized by exo - RT and used for a WB analysis , as well as to challenge target cells ( Figure 5A ) . As expected , downregulation of the intracellular levels of IFITMs led to viruses that incorporated less IFITMs . When the infectivity of exo - RT normalized viral particles produced from control versus IFITM knockdown cells was assessed , the formers displayed a statistically significant increase in infectivity ( two fold ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
