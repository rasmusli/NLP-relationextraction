They are hosted by several species of rodents ( Rodentia ) , insectivores ( Insectivora ) , and bats ( Chiroptera ) [ 4 ] . Little work has been conducted to understand hantavirus infections of insectivores or bats ; however , much is known about the ecology of rodent - borne hantaviruses because of their impact on human health ( Table 1 ) . A central problem of hantavirus / reservoir host research is the lack of reagents and methods for experimentally examining the immune response . Recent experimental work on the immunology of rodent reservoirs , summarized in an exceptional review by Easterbrook and Klein [ 5 ] , has begun to clarify these issues . The immune response is energetically expensive for wild animals , thus the findings of experimental studies will be critical for understanding the ecoimmunology of reservoir hosts of hantaviruses [ 6 , 7 ] , and experiments using wild rodents in natural or semi - natural environments [ 8 , 9 ] will be required to validate laboratory findings .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 24}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 298}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
