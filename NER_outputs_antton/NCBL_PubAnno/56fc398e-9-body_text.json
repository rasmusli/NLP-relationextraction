If appropriate , we then scale the sampled networks up , so that the original number of movements is used for the epidemic simulations . In the UK , selling and buying of livestock often takes place through livestock markets . Previous work suggests that these markets played a substantial role during the 2001 FMD outbreak [ 10 ] . As animals from different farms are kept in close proximity , there is a risk of disease transmission between batches of animals resulting in spread of infection to multiple farms . Moreover , it is known that movements from markets cover a large geographical area [ 37 ] . Therefore , we investigate the potential role of markets in disease transmission between farms .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 499}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
