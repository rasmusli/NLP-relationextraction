The authors discuss this briefly in the Discussion section but this assumption is highly uncertain since almost all of the published epidemiology is based on outdoor PM2 . 5 . The paper would benefit from greater emphasis on the sensitivity of the results to this assumption . Perhaps , the analysis ( or part of it ) could be repeated without the effects of indoorgenerated PM2 . 5 or with a reduced exposure - response coefficient ?", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
