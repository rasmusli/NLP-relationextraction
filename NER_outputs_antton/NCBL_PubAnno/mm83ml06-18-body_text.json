For this purpose HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the HIV - 1 expression plasmid pNLenv1 [ 43 ] which directs efficient expression of all HIV - 1 proteins except the Env glycoproteins . Cells were treated with the following DIs : P22077 , which specifically inhibits the DUBs USP7 and USP47 [ 59 ] , the DI P5091 , which only inhibits USP7 [ 60 ] , and the DI PR - 619 , that , in addition to USP7 and USP47 , inhibits the DUBs Josephin domain containing 2 ( JOSD2 ) , deneddylase 1 ( DEN1 ) , UCH - L3 , UCH - L5 , USP2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 15 , 20 , and 28 [ 59 ] . Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and VLP fractions , using Gag - specific antibodies , revealed that treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 led to an overall defect in Gag processing with prominent accumulation of the Pr55 Gag precursor protein as well as the processing intermediates p25 ( CA - SP1 ) , p41 ( MA - CA - NC ) and p39 ( MA - CA ) in the VLP fractions ( Figure 1A ) . In contrast , addition of the DI P5091 , which is selective for USP7 , had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ) . Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2 - fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR - 619 , whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ) , indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication . Although the DI P22077 and PR - 619 clearly reduced Gag processing , none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
