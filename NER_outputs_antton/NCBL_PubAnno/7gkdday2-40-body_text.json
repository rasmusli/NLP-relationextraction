The most commonly isolated bacteria were S . pneumoniae ( 39 % ) and K . pneumaniae ( 24 % ) . H . influenzae was identified in 6 % cases . Along with S . pneumoniae and K . pneumaniae , we could also detect Streptococcus spp . ( 22 % ) and E . agglomerans ( 9 % ) . S . pneumoniae is a predominant cause of < 5 child mortality and despite the vaccination program , it is responsible for at least 18 % of severe respiratory episodes and 33 % of deaths worldwide [ 25 ] . Other studies conducted in Kenya , Zambia , Nepal , and Brazil reported S . pneumoniae as the most frequently isolated bacteria and the isolation rate ranged from 15 . 8 - 54 . 8 % [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] . K . pneumoniae had been described as the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in Jordan and India [ 30 , 31 ] . It is known that bacterial colonization is mostly facilitated by physical damages of respiratory cells caused by viral infection . However , Yu et al . reported that bacterial colonization following viral infection has no effect on clinical manifestation of ARIs [ 32 ] . Furthermore , the role of bacterial pathogens in ARI symptoms is ambiguous as recent studies of asymptomatic ARI cases reported frequent bacterial colonization [ 33 ] and our study also found comparable detection rates of S . pneumoniae in both asymptomatic and symptomatic children . Many of the bacteria found as coinfection partners with virus in this study , are pathogenic . When bacteria enter a body , the host must elicit immune responses against the invading organisms . However , the immune responses are not always beneficial and sometimes these responses can be harmful , such as in case of hyper immune responses . Even the immune responses elicited by one organism may compromise the immune responses elicited by another organism . Although the pathogenic role of bacterial coinfections with viruses is unclear , they might have involvement in disease pathogenicity . One study reported that , colonization of pathogenic bacteria in airway stimulate topical immune responses [ 34 ] and this phenomenon may play important role in compromising host immune responses . Most of the bacteria isolated during the study period including S . pneumonia , K . pneumaniae , H . influenzae , and E . agglomerans fall in either community - acquired or nosocomical categories , suggesting appropriate preventive measures could limit bacterial involvement in ARIs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 604}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 949}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1198}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1241, "end": 1246}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1304, "end": 1308}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1364, "end": 1368}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
