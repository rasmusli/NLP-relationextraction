PMOs are antisense DNA oligonucleotide analogues [ 54 ] . Their backbone is composed of morpholine rings joined by uncharged phosphodiamidate linkages , in place of the sugar and anionic phosphodiester linkage of DNA . They are typically synthesized as 20 - 25 - base long oligomers . They offer great features for clinical applications : they are water - soluble , nuclease - resistant , and their uncharged backbone interacts weakly with serum and cellular proteins thereby reducing toxicity [ 55 ] . PMOs are mainly designed to interact with 5 ' and 3 ' non - coding regions of the target mRNA , AUG - codon translation start - site region or splice junctions . They As PMOs do not efficiently enter cells on their own , investigators have been routinely arming them with CPPs to promote their uptake into virus - infected cells and enhance their antisense efficacy [ 56 , 57 ] . These peptide - conjugated PMOs are referred to as PPMOs in the literature . As highlighted by Moulton and Jiang [ 58 ] , PMOs are particularly well - suited cargoes for CPPs as their uncharged components do not interact with the positively - charged carrier peptide thereby not interfering with its membrane binding properties . The first report of PPMO antiviral activity in 2004 [ 59 ] has fueled the increasing interest in PMO - technology to inhibit viral infections as witnessed by more than 20 in vit ro and / or in vi vo studies published on antiviral PPMOs within the last five years ( Table 1 ) . Studies on RNA viruses have been extensively reviewed by Stein [ 60 ] with the latest in vivo work discussed by Moulton and Jiang [ 58 ] . We will focus here on the overall findings in regards to the cell penetrating moiety of the conjugates , and we will then review the studies on targeting DNA viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1511, "end": 1517}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
