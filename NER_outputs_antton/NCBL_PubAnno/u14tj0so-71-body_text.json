Since we only run Hot - Knots V2 . 0 partially to produce hotspots it does not take as long as running HotKnots and does not consume as much memory . For example , for the 400 nucleotides long RNA sequence in our data set ( A . tum . RNaseP ) , it only takes 0 . 5 seconds time and 4 MB of memory to produce the hotspots . ( The time required to get the hotspots for all RNA sequences in this data set is provided in Additional file 4 . ) We also note that since calculating hotspots and running Iterative HFold are done sequentially , the memory consumption is calculated as the maximum of the two , so the memory consumption of Iterative HFold for this sequence is still the same even including the memory needed for calculating hotspots . As we can see based on this example , even including time and memory requirements of calculating hotspots , Iterative HFold is still faster than HotKnots and uses less memory .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
