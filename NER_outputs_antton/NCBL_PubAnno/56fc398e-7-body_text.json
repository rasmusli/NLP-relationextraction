Different approaches can be applied to construct contact networks . The most basic methods involve random sampling of nodes ( i . e . individuals or farms [ 28 ] ) or random sampling of edges ( i . e . links between nodes ) . However , it may be possible to capture the key properties of a network more efficiently using an approach such as snowball sampling ( SBS ) . SBS is typically used in situations where the target population is small and hard to find . A number of individuals from the target population are asked to nominate an x number of people from the target population [ 29 ] . This method has been used previously to identify networks of sexual contacts for HIV - positive individuals [ 30 ] . In the case of livestock , when there may be knowledge regarding the size of farms or number of aggregated movements from a farm ( per year ) , a targeted sampling approach could be used where larger farms or farms with the highest number of movements are sampled . When constructing networks , including specific network characteristics ( such as age structure ) improves the quality of the constructed network [ 31 ] . Previous studies have shown that subsets of networks are not always representative of the whole network ( e . g . scale - free networks [ 28 ] ) . Therefore , caution is needed when networks are constructed with partial data .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 794}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
