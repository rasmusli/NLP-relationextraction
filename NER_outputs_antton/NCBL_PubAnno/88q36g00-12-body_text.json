{"cord_uid": "88q36g00", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6003913", "divid": "12", "text": "For the first time , we have demonstrated that maternal H 2 administration improved MIA - induced neurological impairments of offspring , including short - term memory and social interaction at postnatal 3 - 5 weeks . Previously , we reported that maternal H 2 administration suppresses microglial activation in the same model . In the present study , H 2 also suppressed the activation of astrocytes , both in vitro and in vivo . Taken together , these results suggest that H 2 exerts a protective role against MIA - induced neuroinflammation through the suppression of microglia and astrocytes . As a result , mature oligodendrocytes were restored and neurons were protected from damage , thus leading to improved long - term neurological outcomes following maternal H 2 administration . Prenatal exposure to LPS also resulted in a transient reduction in body weight of the offspring between P6 - P10 , which was attenuated by maternal H 2 administration . This might be due to a change in the activity of the hypothalamic - pituitary axis 35 . Deficient post - neonatal growth has been reported to contribute to poor neurologic outcome 36 , thus , the transient decrease of weight observed in this model might be related to the neurological impairments in the offspring .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 123}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 526, "end": 544}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1231, "end": 1256}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
