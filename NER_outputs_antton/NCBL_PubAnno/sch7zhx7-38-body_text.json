Interestingly , we have observed such amino acid changes in our CHIKV passages [ 31 ] , in which we observed a glycine - to - arginine mutation in nsP1 . Given that polyamines are positively - charged at physiological pH , the emergence of positively - charged amino acids in polyamine - depleted conditions suggests potential amino acid compensation for a loss of charge . The amino acids in which we observe mutations for CVB3 2A and 3C are not located in the active sites of either enzyme [ 27 , 38 ] , suggesting that these amino acids and their associated charge may alter enzymatic activity allosterically . Precisely how positively - charged amino acids or polyamines contribute to protease activity remains unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
