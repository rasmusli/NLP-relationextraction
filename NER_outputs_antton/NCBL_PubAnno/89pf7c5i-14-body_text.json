Over the last few decades , many studies have confirmed that feline Leishmania infection may be relatively common in areas where CanL is endemic . Seroprevalence ranges from 0 to 68 . 5 % and molecular rates of infection range from 0 and 60 . 7 % in endemic regions of the Old World ( Table 2 ) . Therefore , a high variability in antibody or molecular prevalences is evident from published investigations , and this may be due to different levels of endemicity , characteristics of the population under study or differences in diagnostic methodologies including the cut - off titres of serology . Moreover , few studies validated the serological techniques in cats by using feline positive control sera obtained from cats with clinical illness confirmed by isolation and negative control sera from a substantial number of cats from non endemic areas [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 31}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 292}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
