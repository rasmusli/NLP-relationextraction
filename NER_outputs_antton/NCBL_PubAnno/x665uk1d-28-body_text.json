Figure 8A shows that PRV gpD RNA was detected in the muscle and brain of WT , STG69 , and STG135 mice accompanied by disease symptoms . Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti - gpD antibody supported the viral gene expression data ; only WT mice with a high infection rate had Purkinje layer cells from the brain that stained dark brown after diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) staining ( Figure 8B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 210}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 378}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
