It typically occurs only between strains of the same species [ 29 ] ; interspecies recombinants are uncommon [ 20 ] . It is noteworthy that we found a peculiar HAdV - 2 / 6 cluster in the present study , likely the recombinants of HAdV - 2 and HAdV - 6 . We have amplified the full hexon from one of HAdV - 2 / 6 recombinants ( GenBank accession No . KP696777 ) . Its position on the phylogenetic tree indicated that the intertypic ( HAdV - 2 / 6 ) recombination occurred in the second half of the hexon gene ( data not shown ) . However , confirmation of this event requires the sequencing of the complete genome .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
