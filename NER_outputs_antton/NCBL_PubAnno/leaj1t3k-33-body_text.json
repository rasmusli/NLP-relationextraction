[ 104 ] . Recently , the investigators have used the tat peptide as part of a bi - directional protein transduction system where the antiviral protein of interest , p27SJ , was expressed with tat at its C - terminal . Secreted into the cell medium , the fusion protein efficiently entered HIV - infected cells through a tat - mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV - 1 transcription and replication ( Figure 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 487}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
