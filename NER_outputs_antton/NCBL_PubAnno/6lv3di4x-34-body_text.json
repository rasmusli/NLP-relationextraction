Porcine nasal mucosa tissue slices 4 m thick were washed in confocal buffer ( CB ; 50 nM ammonium chloride and 0 . 1 % saponin in PBS [UNK] / [UNK] ) for 30 min and then incubated with anti - flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h . After 3 washes with CB , the tissue was incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488 - coupled anti - IgG2a ( Thermo Fisher ) , and Cy3 - conjugated anti - [UNK] tubulin ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) was used for the detection of cilia . Porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS [UNK] / [UNK] and incubated in 4 % PFA for 15 min . In the second step , the membranes were incubated in CB for 30 min . Cells were incubated with anti - ZO - 1 ( Thermo Fisher ) and anti - flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h , followed by Alexa Fluor 633 - coupled goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Thermo Fisher ) , Alexa Fluor 488 - coupled anti - IgG2a ( Thermo Fisher ) , and Cy3 - conjugated anti - [UNK] - tubulin ( Abcam ) . For evaluation of cell death in porcine NEC , Abcam ' s Fixable Cell Viability Assay Kit ( Fluorometric - Blue ) - CytoPainter was applied for 30 min , and then cells were washed with PBS [UNK] / [UNK] and fixed with 4 % PFA , followed by an incubation with anti - flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 as described before and labeling with phalloidin conjugated with AF555 ( Thermo Fisher ) and Alexa Fluor 488 - coupled anti - IgG2a ( Thermo Fisher ) for 1 h . As a positive control for cleaved caspase 3 ( C - Cas3 ) staining , apoptosis in porcine NEC was induced by incubation with anti - human CD90 ( 5E10 ; Becton , Dickinson ) . For detection of apoptotic cells , inserts were fixed with 4 % PFA and incubated in CB for 30 min , incubated with anti - C - Cas3 ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) , anti - flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 for 2 h , washed , and labeled with phalloidin conjugated with AF647 , Alexa Fluor 633 - coupled goat anti - rabbit IgG , and Alexa Fluor 488 - coupled anti - IgG2a ( Thermo Fisher ) for 1 h . All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark . For each staining , 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI , Sigma ) at 2 g / ml was applied for 5 min at 37 \u00b0 C and washed off with PBS \u03ea / \u03ea . Then tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4 - 88 reagent ( Sigma ) . For confocal microscopy analysis , a confocal microscope A1 ( Nikon AG ) combined with an ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope ( Nikon ) and digital imaging Nikon software ( AR 3 . 30 . 02 ) were used . The image acquisitions were performed with the 40\u03eb objective , sequential channel acquisition and not simultaneous was employed ; in order to give high - resolution images , the acquiring setting was performed with optimized voxel size and automatic threshold . The images were analyzed with Imaris 8 . 0 . 2 software ( Bitplane AG , Zurich , Switzerland ) . To avoid false - positive emissions , different settings were applied , including background subtraction , threshold applications , gamma correction , and maxima . Insert surface staining ( for E protein , CytoPainter , and C - Cas3 ) was calculated as average of positive signal of each channel from 20 different nonoverlapping fields in triplicate porcine NECs using confocal microscopy .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
