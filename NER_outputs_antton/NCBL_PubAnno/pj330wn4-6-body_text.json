This process is known as mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) . In the brain , ependymal cilia beat at a frequency of around 40 Hz , moving cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) close to the ventricular wall . Many factors , including inherited ciliary defects in primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , temperature , pH , viscosity and exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens have been shown affect ciliary function [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Recent studies have shown that assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and frequency are essential as cilia may beat in a dyskinetic fashion while maintaining their normal beat frequency [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . The most accurate method for determining ciliary beat frequency , particularly at high beat frequencies is by directly timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles from slow - motion playback of high - speed video files [ 7 ] . However , this is extremely time consuming and automated methods designed to rapidly measure beat frequency from high - speed video recordings are needed [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 424}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 454}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 460}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
