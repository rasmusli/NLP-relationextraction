Vested interests are more noticeable than in other health policy areas since different professional groups coexist in the AMR policy arena and there is substantial profit to be made from selling antibiotics [ 29 , 30 ] . In Singapore , vested interests were mentioned among pharmaceutical companies in marketing for higher sales of their antibiotics for their own profits ; among private practitioners as they make substantial profits when dispensing antibiotics ; and among some veterinarians who prescribed antibiotics even when not clinically needed . Our previous research in other settings ( i . e . , Pakistan and Cambodia ) also suggested several considerations and vested interests around antibiotic use which can hinder the control of AMR in the human and animal health sectors [ 29 , 30 ] . For example , it was reported that among doctors there are monetary incentives to prescribe certain antibiotics as these are often negotiated with pharmaceutical companies . It was also recounted that a large proportion of the income at hospital level and in pharmacies comes from prescribing antibiotics and as a result it might be difficult to introduce stewardship programs to curb their prescription . While these reports were present in Cambodia and Pakistan , they were absent in Singapore . Monetary incentives were not mentioned that often by our participants and were absent at hospital level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 16}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 163}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 291}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 913}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
