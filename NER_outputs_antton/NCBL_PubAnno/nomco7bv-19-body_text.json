Here we queried the participants ' dietary habits and classified them as adhering to a more favourable or more unfavourable dietary pattern according to Winkler et al . [ 38 ] . Aware of the limitations of a one - time assessment of a habitual diet , we found a more pronounced relationship between obesity and infections among obese people who reported an apparent healthier diet . Thus , again only the group of obese individuals who presumably eat a healthier diet showed an increased risk of RTIs . The question arises as to whether misreporting of dietary habits among these individuals with and without RTIs may explain the puzzle . One can imagine that obese individuals may have an increased perception of RTI related symptoms experiencing the contradiction between living a healthy lifestyle and being affected by excess weight and frequent infections . On the other hand the inconspicuous results from the non - obese population with respect to favourable and unfavourable diet pattern would somewhat argue against this explanation . Alternatively , among the group of people with obesity a genetically defined subgroup may exist predisposing to both , excess body weight and proneness to infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 405}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 432}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 518}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 599}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 712}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 764}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 812, "end": 816}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 935}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1189, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1261, "end": 1280}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
