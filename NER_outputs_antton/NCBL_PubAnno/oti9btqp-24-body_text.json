Deletion of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type bnAbs ( broadly neutralising antibodies ) against ZIKV - E protein . 24 The antibody responses induced by the consensus ZIKV - prME appear as robust or in some cases superior in magnitude to those elicited by similarly developed MR766 ZIKV - prME and Brazil ZIKV - prME vaccines . These constructs were sequence matched with the original ZIKV - MR766 isolate or a recently circulating ZIKV strain from Brazil , respectively . While supportive , further study will provide more insight into the effects of such incorporated designed changes on induced immune responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
