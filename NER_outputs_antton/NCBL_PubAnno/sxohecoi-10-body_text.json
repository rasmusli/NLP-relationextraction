Virus was quantified in the medium bathing the basolateral cell surface ( ' ' subnatant fluid ' ' ) by RT - PCR and , although detectable as early as six hours after exposure of virus to the apical cell surface , the quantity was greater at 12 hours ( Figure S1 ) [ 8 ] . Thus , in subsequent experiments , transcytosis was measured at 12 hours . Using HIV - 1 US712 , a clade B R5 clinical isolate , HIVIG enhanced transcytosis in a dose - dependent manner when virus and antibody were exposed to the apical surface at pH 6 . 0 ( Figure 1A ) . There was no increase in transcytosis with HIVIG at pH 7 . 4 or with HIV - negative IgG ( IVIG ) at pH 6 . 0 or 7 . 4 . We found similarly enhanced transcytosis using additional R5 as well as X4 and X4 / R5 strains ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , transcytosis of four of five clade C transmitted / founder Env - pseudotyped viruses was enhanced in a pH and antibody - dependent manner ( Figure 1C ) . Enhanced transcytosis with HIV - 1 - specific antibody at low pH also occurred with T84 colon carcinoma cells ( Figure S2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1302}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
