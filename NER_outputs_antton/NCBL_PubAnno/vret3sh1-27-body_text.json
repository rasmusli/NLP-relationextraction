Reactions in the model are classified as forward essential or reverse essential if they are required for growth to occur , with forward and reverse referring to the direction in which the reactions must proceed . Reactions that are not essential for growth , but still active , are classified as forward variable , reverse variable , and variable , with forward and reverse indicating when reactions proceed only in a single direction . Reactions are classified as blocked if they cannot carry flux under the conditions specified by the user . Metabolites in the model are classified as essential nutrients or essential products if their uptake or secretion is required for growth in the input conditions , and they are classified as transported if they can be taken up or secreted but are not essential for growth . In addition to classifying the reactions and compounds in the model , the FVA simulation returns the maximum and minimum values for the flux through each reactions and the uptake / secretion of each metabolite .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
