Separate full - length cDNAs encoding either the HCV structural protein , nonstructural protein , or all HCV proteins were cloned from HCV R6 strain ( genotype 1b ) RNA by RT - PCR . Each cDNA was inserted into a separate pBMSF7C vector downstream of the pBMSF7C ATI / p7 . 5 hybrid promoter ; the final designation of each recombinant plasmid was pBMSF7C - CN2 , pBMSF7C - N25 , or pBMSF - CN5 ( Figure 2 ) . They were then transfected into primary rabbit kidney cells infected with LC16m8 ( multiplicity of infection = 10 ) . The viruscell mixture was harvested 24 h after the initial transfection by scrapping ; the mixture was then frozen at 280uC until use . The hemagglutinin - negative recombinant viruses were cloned as previously described [ 42 ] and named rVV - CN2 , rVV - N25 , or rVV - CN5 . Insertion of the HCV protein genes into the LC16m8 genome was confirmed by direct PCR , and expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses was confirmed by western blot analysis . The titers of rVV - CN2 , rVV - N25 , and rVV - CN5 were determined using a standard plaque assay and RK13 cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 138}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
