These facts led us to explore the role of antibody and low pH on transcytosis of HIV - 1 across epithelial cells . Our primary finding is that at acidic pH , IgG enhances transcytosis of HIV - 1 clinical isolates , including transmitted / founder Env - pseudotyped strains . Moreover , antibody from both cervicovaginal and seminal fluid mediates enhanced transcytosis at low pH . The enhanced transcytosis is abrogated by blocking or knocking down FcRn , which is known to bind IgG and immune complexes at low pH and release them at neutral pH [ 24 , 42 ] . We also establish that virus translocated across epithelial cells after incubation with antibody at low pH remains infectious . Although neutralizing antibodies generally promote more transcytosis , the transcytosed virus is relatively less infectious than virus whose transcytosis is mediated by non - neutralizing antibodies . Finally , we demonstrate abundant FcRn protein expression in columnar epithelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra , suggesting that these sites could play a major role in FcRn - mediated immune complex transcytosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 77}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
