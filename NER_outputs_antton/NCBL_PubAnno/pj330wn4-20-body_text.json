As opposed to previous studies we validated the software by comparing the results to frequencies obtained using the most accurate method for CBF calculation , directly counting individual ciliary beat cycles during slow - motion playback . Our data showed that the software was validated for use over a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies up to 52 Hz . Table 1 shows that the limits of agreement between the two methods were within the same range as the natural variation that exists between two different observers . Furthermore , the Bland - Altman limits of agreement for human respiratory cilia between the ciliaFA and direct counting methods were very low . Previous software programs validated their results using indirect , less accurate methods , including the early automated photometry method [ 9 ] . Previous studies reported limits of agreement ranging from \u2212 1 . 0 to 1 . 39 Hz [ 9 ] , - 2 . 75 to 5 . 15 Hz [ 7 ] and from \u2212 3 . 89 to 3 . 39 Hz [ 8 ] compared to digital high - speed methods . In our system the image capture instrument is not connected to the software , so analysis performed once the experiment is completed . This allows the software to batch process groups of images using the same settings and thus reducing operator input . This study has clearly demonstrated that ciliaFA is reliable system to analyze CBF . In addition to the accurate measurement of ciliary beat frequency the ciliaFA system has a number of advantages . It has high throughput capabilities allowing significant time savings when processing large datasets , it reduces operator error due to selection bias , and it accurately reports static cilia . The latter is a significant advantage as immotile cilia may not be visible to the observer in multilayered cell cultures . Furthermore , by focusing on particular ciliated areas , ciliaFA can report changes and reductions in ciliary beat frequency .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
