The inlet velocity was 2 . 994 m / s , corresponding to 9 . 7 L / s / person . The air exchange rate for the supply inlet conditions was 36 . 52ACH . The boundary conditions are shown in Table 2 [ 8 , 18 , 19 , 22 ] . The effects of the human thermal plume on the airflow motion was also considered and numerical simulated in the computational geometry . The surface temperature of the seated passengers was numerical set , following the method given by previous studies [ 18 , 19 , 22 ] . Since the inhalation and exhalation airflow velocity in the breathing zone of the person was small [ 30 , 31 ] , the influence of the respiration on aerosols transmission can be regarded as insignificant . So the personal respirations of the passengers were not simulated in this work [ 18 ] . For the respiratory activities of the index patient , breathing and cough is very common for SARS infector . According to previous studies , the droplets expelled by breathing are much smaller and fewer than that of coughing [ 32 ] . So in this work , coughing was considered as the main aerosol release process of the index patient , and the dissemination process of the coughing droplets were numerical simulated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 964, "end": 969}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
