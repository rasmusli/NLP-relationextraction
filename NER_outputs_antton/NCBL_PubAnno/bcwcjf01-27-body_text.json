A recent study demonstrated that the last four amino acids in this region impact the virulence of the virus [ 27 ] ; if the final sequence is ETRL then the virus is attenuated due to induction of neuronal apoptosis . According to this study , virulent , wild type RABV haplotypes have QTRL as the terminal sequence , and do not cause apoptosis of the host cell . The impact of the ETGL haplotype on viral virulence is unclear , although it did not perceptibly impact virulence in skunks and foxes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
