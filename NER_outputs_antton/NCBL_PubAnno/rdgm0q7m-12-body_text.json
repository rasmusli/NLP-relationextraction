Test proteins were diluted where necessary in dilution buffer ( DB ) ( 5 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 05 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol ) and added to reactions ( 10 l final volume ) alongside electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH7 . 6 , 150 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM adenosine triphosphate , 5 % glycerol , 100 g / ml porcine tRNA , 10U RNase inhibitor per ml ) , after which the radiolabelled probe was introduced . After incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 10 min , samples were loaded promptly onto 4 % acrylamide non - denaturing gels ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide ratio 10 : 1 ) and run at 175V at room temperature until free and bound RNA species were resolved . Gels were fixed for 15 min in 10 % acetic acid , 10 % methanol , dried and exposed to X - ray film .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
