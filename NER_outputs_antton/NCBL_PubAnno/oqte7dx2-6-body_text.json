USP - 46 was identified in a focused RNAi screen in C . elegans as the first DUB to regulate GluRs . Usp - 46 loss - of - function mutants exhibit increased levels of ubiquitinated GLR - 1 and decreased levels of GLR - 1 at synapses ( Kowalski et al . , 2011 ) . The abundance of GLR - 1 ( 4KR ) , a mutant receptor which cannot be ubiquitinated , is unaffected in usp - 46 loss - of - function mutants leading to a model where USP - 46 deubiquitinates GLR - 1 to regulate its abundance . USP - 46 regulation of GLR - 1 is physiologically relevant because usp - 46 loss - of - function mutants have reduced cell surface levels of GLR - 1 and corresponding defects in GLR - 1dependent behaviors . Together with data showing that USP - 46 partially colocalizes with endosomes , Kowalski et al . ( 2011 ) proposed a model where USP - 46 acts at endosomes to promote GLR - 1 stability and recycling to the cell surface . Consistent with this model , a recent study showed that mammalian GluA1 ( KR ) , which cannot be ubiquitinated , escapes lysosomal degradation and recycles back to the cell surface ( Widagdo et al . , 2015 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
