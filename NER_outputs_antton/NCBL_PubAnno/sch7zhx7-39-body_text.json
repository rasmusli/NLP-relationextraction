Prior research in oat leaves identified polyamines as factors that reduce cellular protease activity and , as a result , leaf senescence [ 41 ] . The function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells , though . For instance , spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of mammalian chymotrypsin [ 32 , 33 ] . Whether polyamines function broadly in the function of proteases , especially viral proteases , has not been fully explored ; however , our work suggests that viral proteases may be modulated by polyamines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
