Financial challenges within the Canadian Health Care System further enhanced Toronto ' s vulnerability to the SARS epidemic , including a lack of resourcing towards public health infrastructure and acute care ( Salehi and Ali 2006 ) . Similar to MacDougall ( 2007 ) , Salehi and Ali ( 2006 ) point to a lack of cooperation and collaboration between the three levels of government to explain this public health crisis - ownership of responsibility and duty to respond was deflected between each level and remained unclear ( MacDougall 2007 ; Salehi and Ali 2006 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 446, "end": 451}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
