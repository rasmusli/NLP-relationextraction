First , the output of HFold , HFold - PKonly and SimFold methods must contain the given pseudoknot - free input structure , G , whereas Iterative HFold may modify the input structure . This can be useful when the given input structure is not a high - accuracy estimate of G big , the true pseudoknot - free substructure of the reference structure . Second , while HFold and HFold - PKonly can add base pairs that cross those in G , they cannot add base pairs that cross each other , and neither can SimFold . In contrast , Iterative HFold can add base pairs that cross each other . This is particularly useful when the input structure contains limited information about G big , and so it is necessary both to predict base pairs in G big and in G small in order to get a good prediction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
