Briefly , the bait construct pGBKT7 - NS5A ( BD - NS5A ) was transformed into the yeast strain Y2HGold and hybridized with a cDNA library derived from porcine macrophages [ 39 ] . Transformants were selected for growth on synthetically defined ( SD ) medium lacking His , Leu , Trp and Ade ( SD / - 4 ) for 3 to 6 days at 30 [UNK] C . The clones were then transferred to SD / - 4 medium containing 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - \u03b1 - D - galactopyranoside ( X - \u03b1 - Gal ) and aureobasidin A ( Aba ) ( SD / - 4 / X - \u03b1 - Gal / Aba ) . Blue colonies were selected and inoculated with 5 mL of SD / - 4 medium for shaking culture at 30 [UNK] C for 1 to 3 days . Yeast plasmids were extracted using a yeast plasmid kit ( catalog no . D3376 ; Omega , Guangzhou , China ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and the target inserts were verified by sequencing using the Gal4 AD and 3 1 AD primers . To validate the interaction between NS5A and the cellular proteins , the bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain using a yeast transformation system 2 ( catalog no . 630439 ; Clontech ) . The interaction between murine p53 and SV40 large T - antigen was used as a positive control , and the human lamin C protein , which does not interact with the SV40 large T - antigen , was included as a negative control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
