In our model , ADP - ribosylation functions as a post - translational modification of either host or viral factors ( Figure 5A ) . We posit that macro - PARP proteins are recruited to sites of ADP - ribosylation by their macrodomains , most of which are predicted to be able to recognize , but not remove ADP - ribose ( Figure S5 ) , to exert either direct antiviral functions or recruit other antiviral factors . Recruitment of catalytically active macro - PARP genes could also facilitate further ADP - ribosylation of target proteins , allowing macro - PARP proteins to rapidly ' amplify ' an initial signal of ADPr . Such a model of amplification by recruitment and additional ADP - ribosylation by PARP proteins has been seen at sites of DNA damage , where PARP1 activation by ADPr leads to increased ADP - ribosylation [ 7 , 8 ] . We hypothesize that some viruses have overcome this macro - PARP - mediated antiviral response by direct antagonism of macro - PARP proteins ( Figure 5B ) . Such antagonism could drive the rapid evolution we see in several regions of the macro - PARP genes , including but not limited to the macrodomains . However , other viruses , such as togaviruses and coronaviruses , have evolved their own macrodomains to either cleave ADP - ribose ( Figure 5C ) or compete with macro - PARP proteins ( Figure 5D ) , in order to overcome the effects of the macro - PARP proteins . Although speculative , our model provides testable hypotheses about the genetic and physical interactions between PARP macrodomains , viral macrodomains , and ADP - ribose , and their consequences in terms of determining outcomes of viral infections in cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1468, "end": 1480}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1484, "end": 1498}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
