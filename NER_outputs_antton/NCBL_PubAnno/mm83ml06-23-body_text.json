Almost the same result was observed following structured treatment , indicating a severe block in spread of infection caused by DI treatment ( Figure 4B , D ) . No delay in peak virus replication was observed indicating the inhibitory effect of PR - 619 and P22077 must set in immediately after application of the drugs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
