Transcriptome studies using genome - wide microarrays or next - generation deep sequencing of the transcriptome , as well as genome - wide siRNA studies , have revealed a number of pathways to be important during infection process [ 25 , 31 ] . These include immune pathways , apoptotic pathways , cellular transport proteins , proteasomal pathways among others . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Cul4 primers on mosquito midguts . E . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers on mosquito midguts . For all real - time RT - qPCR experiments , RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . For plotting , the mean for controls was arbitrarily set at 1 ( median shown ) and fold - change was calculated for each sample ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 005 , comparing between control and Cul4 - knock - down mosquitoes ) . F . Viral titer estimation conducted by plaque assay in mosquito saliva mixed with cell culture medium . Viral titers from individual saliva samples were plotted on the graph ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 005 , comparing between control and Cul4 - knock - down mosquitoes ) . Control ( GFP dsRNA ) N = 17 ; Cul4 dsRNA N = 17 . Previous studies using microarray analyses to characterize the transcriptional response of mosquitoes to flavivirus infection have shown that a multitude of pathways appear to be involved , including the immune , cell - cycle / apoptosis , metabolic and proteasomal pathways as well as other cellular processes such as the transport machinery [ 10 , 11 ] . Here we adopted an unbiased approach using high - throughput deep sequencing of the mosquito cell transcriptome during a synchronized ( high multiplicity ) infection with WNV . Our data also identified differentially regulated genes from a number of cellular pathways of which we selected ubiquitinproteasomal pathway for further functional analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 106}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1463, "end": 1474}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1886, "end": 1890}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
