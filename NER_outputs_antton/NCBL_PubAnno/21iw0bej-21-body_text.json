An obvious increase in the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 phase was observed for both US / MO / 14 - 18947 ( 25 . 83 % increase ; P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2C ) and US / KY / 14 - 18953 ( 10 . 85 % increase ; P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2D ) . These strains also caused a corresponding increase in the ratio of cells in G0 / G1 - G2 / M ( 53 . 54 % increase for US / MO / 14 - 18947 ; 85 . 91 % increase US / KY / 14 - 18953 ; P < 0 . 001 ; Figures 2C , D ) . Therefore , the currently circulating strains possess increased virulence and a similar ability as the Fermon strain to skew the cell cycle toward the G0 / G1 phase , which facilitates viral production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 56}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
