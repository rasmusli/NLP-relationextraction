The host initially responds to infection by activating innate mechanisms . Genes such as those for sensing and repairing DNA damage and the inflammatory process are under positive selection in black flying foxes and David ' s myotis ( Myotis davidii ) [ 21 ] . For instance , there are mutations in the coding sequence of p53 functional domains that are unique to these bats . Interferons are the primary innate effector molecules that control viral replication . Several types of interferon have been identified in bats , especially Type I and Type III . Type I interferon is induced after virus infection in Egyptian fruit bats whereas Type III interferon is induced similarly in pteropid bats [ 22 , 23 ] . It is interesting to note that interferon genes in black flying foxes have contracted in terms of diversity . The number of variants of interferon present in these bats is lower compared to those in the gene loci of ten other vertebrate species . Despite this decrease in interferon gene diversity , black flying foxes express these variants at higher basal levels than other mammalian species . This suggests that the interferon and interferon stimulated genes are constitutively expressed in these bats [ 18 ] . In contrast , a recent study of the genome of Egyptian fruit bats shows expanded diversity of Type I interferon genes . This , as well as expansion of various other immune genes , suggests novel modes of antiviral defense in bats of various species [ 24 ] . Novel modes of antiviral defenses could exist in other species of bats and future studies would help in revealing them .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 304}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
