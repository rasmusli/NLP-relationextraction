These researchers are leading efforts to discover new species and address knowledge gaps in topics such as bat diversity , distribution , taxonomy , and conservation [ 93 , 98 , 102 , [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] . A few existing networks in the region are aligned with WAB - Net and will be included as part of this multinational One Health initiative . For example , the recently formed Bats of Eastern Europe , made up of bat experts from the Caucasus region , held their first international conference in October 2018 in Yerevan , Armenia [ 141 ] . Also , entities such as The Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network ( EMPHNET ) based in Jordan and the Pak One Health Alliance of Pakistan are conducting critical work to improve public health outcomes and disease surveillance [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] . Despite the value and successes of these few established efforts , most research within the region remains either monodisciplinary , or limited in its geographic scope . The WAB - Net aims to fill a critical need to facilitate interaction : ( 1 ) among bat researchers scattered throughout Western Asia , and ( 2 ) between bat conservationists and those conducting viral disease surveillance within the region . Networking of existing bat researchers into a regional network , together with collaborative efforts to improve disease surveillance initiatives for humans and domestic animals , will help promote One Health solutions to regional threats [ 14 , 145 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1408, "end": 1422}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
