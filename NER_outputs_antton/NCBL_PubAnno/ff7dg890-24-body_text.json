For illustration , we use data from an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school [ 37 ] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching . In the absence of independent data , this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters . Of course , here we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges , since the influenza virus is known to have a latent period of between 1 and 4 d and infected individuals may transmit the virus up to 4 or 5 d after the onset of illness [ 38 ] . We determine the best fit of the model output to daily incidence data by minimizing the least squares errors for different values of the distribution parameters m and n . For comparison , we also determine the best - fit parameters in the absence of any latent period . The least squares errors and estimated R 0 of the best fit for a combination of m and n are presented in Figure 3 . These results clearly illustrate the points raised in the previous section : ( i ) entirely ignoring the latent period gives a significantly lower estimate of R 0 , and ( ii ) the assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods results in consistently lower estimates of R 0 than their gammadistributed counterparts .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 356}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 685}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
