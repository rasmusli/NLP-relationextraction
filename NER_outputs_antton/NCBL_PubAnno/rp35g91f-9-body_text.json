The top 100 transcripts ( mapping to 78 unique genes ) that correlated with the pulmonary myocardium PCA trait were submitted for enrichment analyses and gene ontology ( GO ) using the WEB - based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit ( WebGestalt ) . This resource incorporates information from different public databases including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) , WikiPathways , and human phenotype ontology . We also used the oPOSSUM - 3 Webbased tool ( Kwon et al . 2012 ) to identify overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites and integrated ChIP - seq data from two previously published data sets ( Dupays et al . 2015 ; He et al . 2011 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
