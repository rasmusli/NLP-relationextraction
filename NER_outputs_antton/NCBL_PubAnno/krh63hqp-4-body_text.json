Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957 , when the human strain went extinct . In 1977 , a version identical to those circulating in NE Europe in the early 1950s reappeared in Anshan , China and subsequently spread across the world [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . In 2009 , a swine H1N1 jumped to the human population , causing a widespread pandemic . This has increased concern that H1N1 might mutate into a more virulent form . However , since the pandemic of 1917 , this has not happened . In fact , H1N1 - related human mortality has declined very dramatically and very systematically [ 2 ] . Apart from the 1917 pandemic , H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic , and human H1N1 essentially went extinct from 1957 - 1977 . Since its re - introduction , it has remained a relatively minor cause of influenza mortality [ 2 ] . This applies also to the 2009 outbreak , which caused relatively few deaths in those areas with good reporting systems in place [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 877, "end": 887}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
