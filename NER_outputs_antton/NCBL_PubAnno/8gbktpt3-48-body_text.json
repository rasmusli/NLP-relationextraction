The minimum holding time for unidentified cats in municipal shelters in the states of Victoria and NSW is 7 days , after which cats can be euthanised or rehomed ( Domestic Animals Act 1994 , Companion Animals Act 1998 ) . Changes in euthanasia practices resulting in longer length of stay ( LOS ) may have contributed to a cumulative increase in selection pressure for FPL re - emergence , especially in shelters where vaccination was not practiced . The likelihood of exposure to infectious diseases increases within a shelter environment with increasing LOS [ 39 ] . National data from Royal Society of Prevention to Cruelty ( RSPCA ) shelters show a progressive decline in euthanasia rates from 74 % in 1995 to 27 % in 2018 [ 40 , 41 ] . Similar declines in euthanasia have occurred in shelters in other countries such as Canada [ 42 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 55, "end": 59}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 445}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 573}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
