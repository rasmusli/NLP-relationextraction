RNAs were then extracted using TRIZOL reagent following the instructions provided by the manufacturer . The purity of the isolated RNAs was examined using a spectrophotometer with an A260 / A280 absorbance ratio . The cDNA synthesis was performed using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Roche , IN , USA ) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer . One microgram of RNA was mixed with 60 mM of random hexamer primers and denatured at 65uC for 10 min before adding 16 transcriptor reverse transcriptase reaction buffer , 2 0U of RNase inhibitor , 1 mM of deoxynucleotide mix , Figure 9 . N3 downregulated TNF - a and IL - 1b in CNS and muscle tissues of 5746 - infected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice . RNA was extracted from the brain , spinal cord , and muscles of 5746 - infected 7 - day old hSCARB2 - transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody , and antibody - untreated mice as described in Fig . 4 and were subjected to quantitative RT - PCR specific to ( A ) TNF - a and ( B ) IL - 1b . The relative expression of target gene normalized with the internal control of b - actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig . 7 . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis .

The resulting cDNAs were then subjected to quantitative real - time PCR analysis with EV71 VP1 specific primers . Mouse actin genes in the samples were used as the internal control . To evaluate the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes of different tissues , specified primer pairs were used for the detection of CXCL10 , CCL3 , IL - 6 , TNF - a , INF - a , IFN - b , and IL - 1b . The sequences of primer pairs specific to the target genes were the same as previously noted in [ 11 ] . To determine the expression of IFN - c , Taqman assay was performed using specific primers 59 - TCAAAAGAGTTCCT - TATGTGCCTA - 39 ( Forward ) and 59 - TACGAGGACGGA - GAGCTGTT - 39 ( Reverse ) and the probe No . 69 from Universal Probe Library ( Cat . No . 04688686001 , Roche ) . Maxima probe / ROX qPCR Master Mix ( 2X ) ( Cat . No . K02331 , Thermo Scientific ) was used following the program and procedures provided by the manufacturer . All primer sets were synthesized commercially by Mission Biotech , Taiwan . The optical density reading of N3 against na\u00efve EV71 genotypes showed high affinity on E59 which was used to raise the antibody . The affinities of N3 on EV71 5746 and CVA16 were reduced . However mouse anti - CVA16 antisera showed similar affinity on detection of these virions . Isotype antibody was also included as background control . ( TIF ) Figure S4 Protein analysis profiles of N3 and mouse anti - CVA16 on different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 . Purified and concentrated EV71 and CVA16 were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane for Western blotting with N3 ( A ) , mouse anti - CVA16 antisera ( B ) or isotype antibody ( C ) . ( A ) N3 detected VP1 proteins at approximately 35 kDa from both genotypes of EV71 [ 17 , 37 ] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [ 39 ] . ( B ) anti - CVA16 antisera detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa . ( C ) Isotype antibody did not detect any protein from both EV71 genotypes and CVA16 . ( TIF )", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
