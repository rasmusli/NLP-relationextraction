Positive selection is a hallmark of host genes locked in genetic conflict with viruses that counter - evolve to evade the host antiviral defenses , and has been seen in both antiviral kinases and antiviral ubiquitin ligases [ 34 ] . Positive selection is characterized by the accumulation of amino acid - altering , nonsynonymous changes in the DNA at a rate that is greater than the accumulation of neutral , synonymous changes . When such protein changes are recurrently selected for ( due to their adaptive advantage ) , the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates exceeds one ( dN / dS . 1 , where dN is the nonsynonymous substitution rate and dS is the synonymous substitution rate ) . Such analyses can not only identify a gene that has evolved under positive selection but can also pinpoint domains and even individual codons within that gene located at the direct interface between host and viral factors [ 35 , 36 ] . We previously analyzed primate PARP13 orthologs to determine if the direct antiviral activity of PARP13 has led to a genetic conflict with viruses . Indeed , consistent with its antiviral function , we found a robust signature of positive selection in PARP13 in primates [ 37 ] . Interestingly , despite the fact that the zinc - finger domains of PARP13 directly bind viral RNA [ 27 ] , we found no signature of positive selection in these domains . Instead , we found sites of positive selection in the PARP catalytic domain , implying that this domain is a target for genetic conflict with viruses [ 37 ] . Although this domain in PARP13 appears to lack catalytic activity [ 4 ] , we nevertheless found that its removal from PARP13 decreased the level of viral restriction [ 37 ] , arguing that some function of the PARP domain remains intact . Thus , using an evolutionary signature of positive selection as a guide , we were able to identify a domain important for the antiviral activity of PARP13 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
