The lack of activity of PCBP4 and hnRNP K / J is potentially a consequence of differences in overall size and domain organization . PCBP1 , 2 and 3 are globally similar , with KH domains located at analogous positions in the protein , whereas the linker separating KH2 and KH3 is shorter in PCBP4 and much longer in hnRNP K / J ( Figure 3D ) . These differences did not affect association of PCPB4 with nsp1 [UNK] , but could affect the strength of binding of individual KH domains to RNA or alternatively , preclude generation of a correctly oriented or positioned complex on the mRNA . With the KH domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2 , we largely observed an excellent correlation between activity in RNA binding , ribosomal pausing and the capacity to induce PRF . However , we saw differential activity in PRF of the KH1 domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2 , with the former barely active yet the latter retaining function in promoting \u2212 1 PRF , but with reduced \u2212 2 PRF . When RNA association was examined by EMSA , PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m bound to the PRRSV RNA with similar affinity and in an nsp1 [UNK] - dependent manner , although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the WT proteins . This suggests that PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m still associate with the RNA , but the stability , conformation or position of the complex may be changed such that only in the case of PCBP2 KH1m is PRF possible , and only \u2212 1 PRF ( which is the predominant frameshift event for WT PCBP2 at the natural spacing distance ) . As noted in the ' Results ' section , compensatory activity in PRF was detected upon mixing the individually inactive PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP1 KH3m , suggesting that two ( or more ) PCBPs can cooperate to stimulate frameshifting . The differential activity of PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m could reflect an altered capacity to homo - oligomerize .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
