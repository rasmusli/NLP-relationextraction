For the expression of HCV proteins in E . coli , corresponding coding sequences were cloned into the histidine fusion expression vectors , pET32a ( + ) and pQE30 , or the GST - tag expression vector , pGEX - 4T - 2 , as shown in Table I and Fig . 1 . Recombinant plasmids were examined and confirmed by PCR amplification , restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing . We successfully produced a set of recombinant proteins derived from HCV structural ( core , E1 and E2 ) and non - structural proteins ( NS2 , NS3 , NS4A , NS4B , NS5A and NS5B ) in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells by using the E . coli expression system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
