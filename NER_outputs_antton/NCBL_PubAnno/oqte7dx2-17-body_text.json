CreB , which is homologous to USP46 and USP12 , and CreC , which is homologous to WDR20 , were identified in a screen for genes involved in carbon catabolite repression and gene expression . Genetic experiments revealed that CreC acts upstream of CreB and that CreC stabilizes CreB by interacting with and preventing proteolysis of the DUB ( Lockington and Kelly , 2002 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
