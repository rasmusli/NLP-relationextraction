Many scholars pointed to flaws in the funding and organization of Canada ' s health care system - federally , provincially , and municipally - to explain the SARS outbreak in Toronto . Some argued that information was communicated inefficiently and was often incorrect ( Silas et al . 2006 ) . Personal protective equipment was in short supply ( Summers 2009 ) , and the use of occupational health and safety in Toronto ' s hospital system was inefficient , leading to further spread ( Silas et al . 2006 ) . Toronto ' s hospital system was also blamed for lacking admission policies and public laboratories ( Wong et al . 2007 ) : an inability to supply health services when demand suddenly increased and a lack of quality leadership ( Arya et al . 2009 ) . Toronto was also ill - prepared to address the unique vulnerability of the homeless to SARS ( Leung et al . 2008 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 70}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 239}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 424}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
