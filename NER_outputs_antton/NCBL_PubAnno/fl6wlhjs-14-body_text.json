Paul , Milwaukee , Chicago , Akron , and Columbus ) , supplemented with time series of daily average temperature , obtained from the Average Daily Temperature Archive at The University of Dayton [ 15 ] . These series are shown in Figure 1 . There seems to be strong seasonal component in the chest radiograph and visit series , for all the cities , which is negatively correlated with temperature . Although it could be argued that we do not have enough years of data to prove this empirically , it is expected that a higher number of respiratory complaints is associated with colder temperatures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 789}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
