The increased T cell effector cell phenotype indeed correlated with elevated levels of mRNA for T cell derived pro - inflammatory cytokines IFN - \u03b3 and IL - 2 ( Figure 2D ) . Although there is no evidence suggesting peripheral virus replication during persistent infection , the presence of JHMV within CNS - draining lymph nodes was indeed supported by detection of low levels of mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid ( N ) protein in control DTR \u2212 mice ( Figure 2D ) . In contrast , increased T cell activation correlated with a reduction of viral N mRNA to below detection within CLN of DTR + mice at day 28 p . i . ( Figure 2D ) . Since IFN - \u03b3 has antiviral activity ( 31 , 32 ) , elevated IFN - \u03b3 as a result of increased antiviral T cell activity in the absence of Treg is consistent with a decline in viral RNA .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 500}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
