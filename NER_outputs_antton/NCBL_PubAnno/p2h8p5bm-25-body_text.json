What we are aware of ; no animal experiments have shown any significance of the TLR3 - TRIF pathway in tick - borne flavivirus infection . However , several studies have looked at the prevalence of polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene in TBE patients [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] . In particular , one polymorphism has been investigated the T allele in rs3775291 . This polymorphism has been shown to reduce TLR3 signaling by about 30 % [ 137 ] . Although the data regarding TLR3 is somewhat conflicting , Grygorczuk et al . hypothesized that a functional TLR3 facilitates the onset of neurological disease [ 135 ] by supporting the penetration through the blood brain barrier , but has a protective effect during the established CNS infection [ 134 ] . The differences between studies might also be connected to the different subtypes of the TBEV strain and the genetic background of the studied populations [ 134 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 100}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 371}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 470}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 838}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 961, "end": 975}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1074, "end": 1079}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
