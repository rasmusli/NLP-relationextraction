Nasal mucosa explants were isolated from four 3 - month - old pigs at a local slaughterhouse . The nasal cavity was opened in the longitudinal axes , and nasal mucosa was removed in strips ( 3 by 8 cm ) . After the tissues were rinsed with minimum essential medium ( MEM ; Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with antibiotics ( 100 U / ml of penicillin , 100 g / ml of streptomycin , 0 . 25 g / ml of amphotericin B , and 50 g / ml of gentamicin ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , they were placed onto sterile surgical compresses sodden with fresh MEM and kept on ice . Surgical compresses were cut in squares of 1 . 2 cm , placed in 12 - well plates , and filled until the top of the compress surface with bronchial epithelial growth medium ( BEGM [ 68 ] ) , supplemented with antibiotics ( see above ) . Next , the nasal mucosa tissues were cut in 1 - cm squares and placed onto the compresses in 12 - well plates and refilled with medium , keeping the apical side of the tissue at the ALI . After incubation overnight at 37 \u00b0 C in 5 % CO 2 , mucus was washed away with BEGM , and mucosa pieces were transferred to new empty 12 - well plates without compresses . There tissues were challenged with JEV at 10 5 TCID 50 s / ml in 400 l , incubated for 1 . 5 h at 37 \u00b0 C , and washed 3 times with BEGM . In order to establish again the ALI conditions , mucosa was transferred onto new freshly prepared 12 - well plates with compresses and fresh BEGM with antibiotics . After 2 , 24 , and 48 hpi one piece of tissue per condition and animal was processed for RNA extraction . At 72 hpi , additional tissues were embedded and cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound ( OCT ; Leica Microsystems ) . Using a cryostat , nasal mucosa sections at a thickness of 4 m were cut and then fixed with acetone - methanol ( 1 : 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 4}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1018, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1365, "end": 1369}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
