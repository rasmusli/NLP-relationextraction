{"cord_uid": "26lvnqaq", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6116506", "divid": "69", "text": "From 2 weeks up to 80 days pi , the number of eggs increased but reverted to only 65 % of the pre - infection average production . Interestingly , the 3 / 10 layers that did not lay eggs 11 weeks pi had egg yolk material in the abdomen and normal ovaries with multiple follicles . Histological examinations linked the presence of yolk to a severe distortion of the architecture of the infundibulum , where we recorded thinning of the mucosa , diffuse presence of reactive plasmacytic aggregates and the atypical presence of ectatic glands in the lamina propria . Although we could not examine the birds beyond the eleventh week post - infection and throughout their entire commercial life , we reckon that the histological impediment of the infundibulum had become a chronic condition that could have permanently undermined the ability of this tissue to actively capture ova and convey them to the magnum . On the other hand , the rest of the birds completely recovered from the infection , showing no chronic lesion throughout the oviduct .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
