Again , based on the result of the permutation test , the difference in the results of HFold and Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free structures are not significant . Similarly , the permutation test shows that the difference in prediction accuracy of HFold and Iterative HFold on SimFold input is not significant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
