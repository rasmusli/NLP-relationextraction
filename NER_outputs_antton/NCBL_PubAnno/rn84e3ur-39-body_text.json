However , all of the three movement behaviors ( moving speed of 0 , 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 m / s during each cough ) might happen during the flight and the movement of the moving person may not be so frequently . To verify whether a combination of case 1 ~ 3 may be more likely to happen in the real case , a range of combinations of case 1 ~ 3 are also investigated in the likelihood analysis according to Eq .
