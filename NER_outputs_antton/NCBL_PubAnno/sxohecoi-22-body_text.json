This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for FcRn in immune complex shuttling across tissues [ 34 , 35 , 43 ] . Mice expressing human FcRn in intestinal epithelial cells were able to deliver IgG to the luminal intestinal surface , which could then bind to its cognate antigen and return the immune complex back to the lamina propria for presentation by dendritic cells to CD4 + T cells [ 34 ] . In addition , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) applied to human placental explants from women with high anti - CMV neutralizing antibody activity was rapidly transcytosed across syncytiotrophoblasts and captured by villus macrophages [ 35 ] . Under these conditions , the virus did not replicate . However , in explants from CMV - seropositive women with low or undetectable neutralizing antibodies , virus replication readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact , uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer . Thus , it appeared that neutralizing antibody inhibited infection after allowing virus to cross the syncytiotrophoblast layer . On the other hand , non - neutralizing antibody allowed or even promoted infection . Syncytiotrophoblasts express high levels of FcRn , and when FcRn on explants was blocked , IgG - virion complexes were not transported across the surface [ 35 ] . Just as we found with HIV - 1 , FcRn - mediated transcytosis of CMV occurred with both neutralizing and poorly neutralizing antibody , but transcytosed virus remained infectious only when complexed with poorly neutralizing antibody . Finally , immunohistochemical staining of placentas from in utero infections were consistent with this model of FcRn - mediated transcytosis [ 35 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 582}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 868, "end": 887}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
