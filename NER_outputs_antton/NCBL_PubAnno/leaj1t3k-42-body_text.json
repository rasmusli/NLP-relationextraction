It is very likely that escape mutants will arise during treatment , especially if long - term therapy is required . This issue can be overcome if treatment can be easily switched to different antisense molecules . The ease to synthesize a new CPP - PNA , CPP - siRNA or PPMO directed to the mutated sequence needs to be addressed . According to Stein , PPMO production is costly and complex [ 60 ] . Most investigators limited their in vi vo studies to the most potent PPMO identified in cell culture . However , treatment with a combination of antisense molecules targeting multiple sequences in the viral genome should have a greater antiviral effect compared to a treatment with a single antisense molecule , and should prevent selection of escape variants . More studies with treatment with a cocktail of antivirals would be of critical relevance for further clinical applications .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 66}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
