J\u00e4rver et al . suggested that siRNAs could be less amenable to CPP delivery due to charge interactions between the peptide and the siRNA and inefficient endosomal escape of the conjugates [ 30 ] . To our knowledge , the only report of CPP - mediated delivery of antiviral siRNA is from Meng et al . who constructed a cell - permeable siRNA targeting hepatitis C virus 5 ' untranslated region [ 102 ] . The siRNA was crosslinked at its 3 ' end with the tat peptide . The authors reported the cellular uptake and antiviral effect of the CPP - siRNA as being as efficient as transfection with lipofectamine in Huh - 7 cell culture . However , some cell types being refractory to lipofectamine transfection which can moreover be toxic in vivo , CPP - mediated delivery of siRNA is definitely worth investigating in other cell types and in animal models of viral infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 477}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 984}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
