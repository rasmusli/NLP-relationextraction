Those proteins belonged to six different categories based on protein function , while two out of the five proteins that were analyzed using western blotting were not classified according to biological processes ( apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor ) . The biological functions of the remaining proteins in HBV infection and progression that were analyzed have not yet been elucidated ; however , a number of theories are discussed in the following section .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 79}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 113}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 553}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
