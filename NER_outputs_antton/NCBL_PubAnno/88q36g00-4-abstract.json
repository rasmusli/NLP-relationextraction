{"cord_uid": "88q36g00", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6003913", "divid": "4", "text": "We have previously suggested that the maternal administration of molecular hydrogen ( H 2 ) plays a neuroprotective role in the fetal brain against injury caused by oxidative stress and inflammation 12 - 14 . Ohsawa et al . discovered that H 2 acts as an antioxidant that selectively neutralizes hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH ) and protects the brain from injury 15 . H 2 reacts with strong oxidants , such as \u2022 OH , but remains mild enough to neither disturb the metabolic redox reactions nor affect ROS signaling . Several subsequent studies have explored the therapeutic and preventive effects of H 2 , and have indicated that H 2 has other properties as well , including anti - inflammatory and anti - apoptotic effects 16 , 17 . The safety and some promising benefits of H 2 have already been demonstrated , not only in animal models but also in patients , including those with Parkinson ' s disease 18 , diabetes mellitus 19 and mild cognitive impairment 20 , although no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted to date . Recently , we demonstrated that the administration of H 2 to pregnant mouse dams significantly increased H 2 concentration in the fetal brain , through the maternal - fetal interface , in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced MIA 12 . Fetal damage in this MIA model and the effect of maternal H 2 administration on this damage can be summarized as follows 12 : ( 1 ) high mortality rate of MIA fetuses , ( 2 ) brain injury associated with elevated levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines , aberrant microglial activation , and oxidative damage in the MIA fetal brains , and ( 3 ) attenuation of these adverse outcomes by maternal H 2 administration . Thus , the protective effect of maternal H 2 administration on short - term outcomes in the MIA offspring has been demonstrated . However , long - term outcomes of the surviving offspring are yet to be investigated . Therefore , the present study investigated long - term neurological outcomes in the MIA mouse model and the efficacy of H 2 administration in pregnant dams , using both histological and behavioral examinations . Astrocytes , which are the most abundant cell population in the CNS , play a key role in normal brain development 21 , 22 . However , when astrocytes are exposed to maternally - derived cytokines in MIA models , they secrete various cytokines that lead to neurodevelopmental impairments 23 . Moreover , activation of astrocytes is known to be a factor in the prolongation of brain damage , and contributes to the formation of glial scars that limit neuronal plasticity 24 . Thus , in the present study , the MIA - related astrocytic activation and its modification by H 2 administration were also investigated , both in vivo and in vitro .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 182}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 900}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 923}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 935, "end": 956}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1295}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1444, "end": 1448}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1464, "end": 1477}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1796, "end": 1800}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 2332, "end": 2336}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
