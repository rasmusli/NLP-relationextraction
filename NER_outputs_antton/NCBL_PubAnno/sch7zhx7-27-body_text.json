While previous reports have suggested that polyamines enhance chymotrypsin activity [ 32 , 33 ] , a role for polyamines in viral protease activity has never been reported . Toward this end , we treated cells with increasing doses of DFMO or DENSpm to deplete cellular polyamines . Following incubation with a drug , cells were infected at MOI 10 for 24 h , at which time cellular lysates were collected for western analysis . Lysates were analyzed for the presence of cleaved eIF4G , a cellular target of the viral proteases . We observed that in infected cells , a distinct eIF4G band was present ; however , in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm , eIF4G cleavage was significantly restricted ( Figure 4A ) . We were unable to visualize full - length eIF4G , likely due to its large size .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
