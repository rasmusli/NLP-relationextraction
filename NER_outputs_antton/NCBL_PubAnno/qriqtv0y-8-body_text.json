Genome organization of CaKoV includes leader protein ( L ) , structural proteins ( VP0 , VP3 , VP1 ) , nonstructural proteins ( 2A , 2B , 2C , 3A , 3B , 3C , 3D ) . Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Thai CaKoVs were closely related to each other and clustered with Aichivirus A . It is noted that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from the viruses from the US , UK , Brazil and Tanzania ( Fig . 3 ) . Phylogenetic analyses of 3D gene showed similar result which Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs ( G1 sub - cluster ) . This observation regarding to the sub - clusters of CaKoVs was in agreement with the previous study [ 23 ] . On the other hand , based on VP1 gene , the viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups , US / EU / Africa subgroup and China / Thailand subgroup which similar to the previous reports [ 16 , 22 ] ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 454}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
