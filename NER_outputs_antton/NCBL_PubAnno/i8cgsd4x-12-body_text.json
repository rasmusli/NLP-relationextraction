Hsu cells were transfected with long dsRNA against CxCul4 , infected with WNV at 24 h post - transfection , and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi . As a control , cells were either left untransfected ( No dsRNA ) or were transfected with dsRNA against GFP ( GFP dsRNA ) . Real - time RT - qPCR showed a significant decrease ( > 80 % ) in CxCul4 mRNA , indicating efficient knock - down of the gene ( S4 Fig ) . There was also a significant decrease ( > 75 % ) in WNV NS1 RNA in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA , indicating a decrease in viral replication , compared to control ( No dsRNA and GFP dsRNA ) cells ( Fig 3B ) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media showed greater than 10 - fold decrease in viral titers following CxCul4 knock - down ( 75 pfu / ml ) compared with No dsRNA ( 900 pfu / ml ) and GFP dsRNA ( 800 pfu / ml ) ( Fig 3C ) . In a parallel experiment , western blots performed using Culex cullin ( Cul4 ) is pro - viral . A . Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes ( n = 40 ) were infected with WNV by blood feeding . Mosquitoes were microdissected at 24 hpi and total RNA was collected from the midgut and the remaining carcass . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex cullin ( Cul4 ) primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from four pooled mosquitoes with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and WNV - infected carcasses and midguts ) . B . Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin ( Cul4 dsRNA ) . No dsRNA or GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between No dsRNA , GFP dsRNA and Cul4 - knock - down cells ) . C . Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in B . D . Western blot anti - NS5 antibody showed a significantly lower level of WNV NS5 in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA compared with control cells ( GFP dsRNA ) ( Fig 3D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 92, "end": 96}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 186}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1152, "end": 1156}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1583}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
