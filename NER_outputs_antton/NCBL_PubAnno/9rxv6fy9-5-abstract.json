The biophysical reason is that , due to its strong absorbance in biological materials , far - UVC light does not have sufficient range to penetrate through even the outer layer ( stratum corneum ) on the surface of human skin , nor the outer tear layer on the outer surface of the eye , neither of which contain living cells ; however , because bacteria and viruses are typically of micron or smaller dimensions , far - UVC light can still efficiently traverse and inactivate them [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
