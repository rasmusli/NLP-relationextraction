Among middle - aged adult cats , consistency in the stimulatory potential of this molecule was reflected through the highly similar patterns in gene expression profiles induced in immune cells after stimulation , as well as through the moderate deviations in those experiments aiming to characterize the immunomodulatory properties of ODN 2216 ( Figure 1 ) . The cells of several animals however , in particular cat c08 , but also c09 and c12 , indicated particularly strong responsiveness to stimulation throughout the study . Such observations are most likely linked to the genetic variability of individuals of an outbred species , as inherited factors are known to play an important role in the magnitude of innate immune responses [ 69 ] . With respect to this observation , it should be noted that the SPF origin and maintenance in a barrier facility of the animals included in this study may slightly lower the variability in strength and breadth of innate immune responses , and studies with cells obtained from field cats would give further information on divergence in response to stimulation of the innate immune cells of individual animals . The immune cells of cats of 14 years of age seemed to respond slightly less well to ODN 2216 than those of younger adult animals , while PBMCs of kittens indicated much more reticence to stimulation , with either limited or absent upregulation of both type I IFN and other genes measured after incubation with ODN 2216 . Stimulated PBMCs from this group of young animals moreover indicated a tendency to develop an immunologic environment with a Th2 orientation , including higher production of IL - 4 and impaired induction of IL - 12 compared to cells from adult cats . Although the kittens included in this study were already of 10 weeks of age , these observations strongly corroborate the immature IFN system of neonatal mice [ 70 ] , the impaired immune cell activation via TLR9 in human neonatal mononuclear cells [ 71 , 72 ] and the bias towards Th2 rather than Th1 responses in human fetuses and neonates [ 73 , 74 ] . Furthermore , concordantly to findings in human neonatal blood [ 75 , 76 ] , basal TLR9 transcription in kit indicated levels similar to those of adults . However , ODN 2216 stimulation increased mRNA expression of this gene only in the young animals ( Figure 2C ) . These results open new perspectives on possible explanations for the qualitative discrepancy between innate immune responses in newborns and adults . The availability of specific antibodies to feline TLR9 would greatly support further investigations in this direction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
