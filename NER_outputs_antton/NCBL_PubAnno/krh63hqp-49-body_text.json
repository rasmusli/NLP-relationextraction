The greatest influenza threat , therefore , is the introduction of a non - attenuated strain from some natural reservoir . This suggests that a better understanding of the origin of such non - attenuated strains should be a priority [ 5 ] . Our findings suggest that new strategies that accelerate natural genetic attenuation of RNA viruses may prove useful for managing future pandemics and , perhaps in the long run , precluding the genesis of new influenza strains .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 196}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 633}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
