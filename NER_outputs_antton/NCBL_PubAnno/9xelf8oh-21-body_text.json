S7 . 1 for positions on control / target genes ) ; secondary structures ( hairpins , homo - and hetero - dimerization ) of primers , probes and templates were assessed within the software used . All undesirable secondary structures had a delta G ( \u0394G ) > \u2212 2 and melting temperature ( T m ) at least 30 \u00b0 C less than the chosen T a . These suggested inhibitory secondary structures at the reaction temperature were highly unlikely to form and thus have little detrimental effect on the desired PCR reaction . PCR product sequences were confirmed to be the same as predicted target sequences ( Online Resource S7 , Fig . S7 . 2 - 7 . 7 ) . Brief comparisons between SYBR \u00ae green and hydrolysis probe methods demonstrated that both chemistries yielded comparable values of C p . Moreover , completing the assays as either duplexes or triplexes had little impact on C p values . ( A summary of these results is provided in the Online Resource S8 , Fig . S8 . 1 ) . Optimal primer / probe concentrations varied between 200 and 400 nm for uniplex reactions ( Table 1 ) . While satisfactory efficiencies ( i . e . E > 90 % but < 110 % ) with duplex reactions were achieved using the same primer / probe concentrations as for uniplex reactions ( see Online Resource S8 , Fig . S8 . 2 - 3 for standard curves ) , triplex reactions required primers and probes to be of equal concentration ( 200 nM ; as per the manufacturer ' s recommendation ) to achieve reaction efficiencies comparable to those recorded in duplex reactions ( Fig . 1 ) . All assays had maximised amplification over a 5 - 10 \u00b0 C range in T a , with a T a of 60 \u00b0 C acceptable for all assays ( Table 1 ) . A total of 200 ng of total DNA per reaction provided the best compromise between obtaining a low C p value and maintaining assay sensitivity for both multiplexes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
