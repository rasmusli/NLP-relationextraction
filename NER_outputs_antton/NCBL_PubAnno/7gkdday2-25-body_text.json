Table 3 shows a comparison of distribution patterns of indicated respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens between < 1 year and 1 - 5 year age groups . As we can see here , the total number of specimens which had come out positive for pathogens was significantly higher in less than one year age group ( 87 % ) compared to [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The majority of respiratory viral pathogens were highly prevalent in < 1 year age group of children and the detections of HRV ( 54 / 63 ) and RSV ( 54 / 62 ) were almost confined to this age group . However , a significant P value was found in case of RSV ( P = 0 . 0473 , RR = 1 . 167 ( 7 ) 10 ( 6 ) 4 ( 9 ) NA - - ( 8 / 11 ) were confined to less than 1 year old children , although the results did not show significant differences between the two age groups . Notably , pathogen detection rates dropped to almost 2 % for all viruses for more than three - year old children ( data not shown ) . Due to nil or very low levels of pathogen detection frequency ( less than five ) , \u03c7 2 - test was not performed for pathogens other than HRV , RSV , HBoV , and HMPV . Over all , the data suggest that under - one children are more likely to receive attention due to their vulnerability to infections by respiratory viral pathogens . Coinfection is a frequently occurring phenomenon in numerous infections and this phenomenon has attracted a great deal of recent attention . Respiratory viral pathogens including influenza virus have been reported to predispose to secondary bacterial pulmonary infections [ 16 ] , hence , data analysis targeting coinfection patterns was performed . Out of 46 bacterial isolates , 40 ( 87 % ) were associated with coinfections . On the other hand , 59 % ( 126 out of 213 ) of total viral agents were accomplices in coinfections . In summary , the data indicate that coinfection is a major phenomenon in under - five children with ARI illness and the results are consistent with previously published reports on this subject .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1640, "end": 1671}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 2029, "end": 2041}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
