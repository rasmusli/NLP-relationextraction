S5 ) . To investigate the mode of binding of diplacone to the enzyme , we determined the structure of Cp - NanI in complex with diplacone . The structure of Cp - NanI CD in complex with diplacone shows little deviation from previously published structures . The - propeller fold within the apo structure ( PDB entry 2vk5 ; Newstead et al . , 2008 ) and the structure of Cp - NanI in complex with the substrate Neu5Ac ( N - acetylneuraminic acid ; PDB entry 2bf6 ; Newstead et al . , 2008 ) show root - meansquare deviations ( r . m . s . d . s ) relative to our structure of 0 . 12 and 0 . 11 \u00c5 , respectively ( Figs . 2a and 3a ) . Consistent with our kinetic analysis , diplacone was bound to the enzyme active site . The principal interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions . The 3 0 , 4 0 , 5 , 7 0 - hydroxyl - 4 - oxo group and the O atom at the 1 - position of diplacone form direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with side chains of the tri - arginyl cluster ( Arg266 , Arg555 and Arg615 ) as well as residues Arg285 , Asp328 , Phe353 , Tyr485 , Gln493 , Thr538 , Tyr655 and the main chain of Ala292 , in addition to three water molecules ( W1 , W2 and W3 ) ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The flavanone backbone of diplacone also displays hydrophobic contacts with Ile327 , Phe347 , Phe460 , Tyr485 and Tyr655 , which orientate the inhibitor correctly and stabilize the bound conformation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
