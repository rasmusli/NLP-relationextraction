The proportion of visits for asthma that we describe ( 2 . 6 % ) is similar to that reported by Nath and Hsia in 2015 in a United States study ( 2 . 8 % ) [ 9 ] . According to what is described by Bekmezian et al . [ 10 ] , most patients were males and preschool - aged children . \" Green \" and \" yellow \" triage priority labels were the most frequently assigned to our patients ; the severity was most often judged as mild or moderate and only in 4 % of the patients as severe . Bekmezian et al . studied 1249 Pediatric ED visits for moderate - to - severe asthma exacerbations and reported that only 1 % of them had a triage priority code \" 1 \" ( comparable to our \" red \" ) ; in most cases , a \" 2 \" or \" 3 \" code was assigned and , less frequently , a \" 4 or 5 \" code [ 10 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 61}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 133}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 655, "end": 662}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
