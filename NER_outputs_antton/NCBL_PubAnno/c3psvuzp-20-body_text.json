In contrast , other PARP genes are present in all genomes we examined , with the exception of PARP10 , which has been lost in the carnivore lineage . To explore the dynamics of PARP15 birth and loss , we conducted a more in - depth survey of PARP15 genes in vertebrate genomes ( Figure S5 ) . We found that PARP15 was born early in mammalian evolution via a partial duplication of PARP14 , consisting of the second and third macrodomains and the PARP domain . We found that PARP15 has been independently lost via deletion or inactivating mutations in five different mammalian lineages ; PARP15 is therefore absent from gibbons , all glires ( rodents and lagomorphs ) , the cow / sheep / dolphin clade , alpaca / camel , and armadillo ( Figure 4B ) . Elephant and manatee have a conserved but shorter form of PARP15 , missing the first of the two macrodomains . In contrast to these losses in PARP15 , we identified several PARP14 duplications that occurred both within and outside the lineage that contains PARP15 . For instance , although fish and birds lack PARP15 orthologs , many fish and bird genomes have one or more additional copies of PARP14 that could possibly serve PARP15 - analogous functions . Guinea pig and bushbaby each appear to have at least one extra intact copy of PARP14 , with the caveat that in each case a single exon is within a genome assembly gap . The microbat ( Myotis lucifigus ) genome contains at least eight PARP14 / 15 genes , of which at least two copies are intact ( two additional genes are incomplete in the assembly but are uninterrupted in available sequence by stop codons or frameshifts , suggesting they are also intact ) ( Figure 4B ) . Moreover , pairwise comparisons of duplicated PARP14 genes in microbat and bushbaby suggest that these paralogs may have regions that have rapidly diverged under positive selection ( Figure S7 ) , although additional sequences will be required to strengthen such a conclusion . Coupled with our findings that both PARP14 and PARP15 are evolving under positive selection in primates ( Figure 3 ) , the gene turnover we describe for PARP14 and PARP15 supports the idea that these genes have been selected for functional innovation , perhaps in response to a recurrent genetic conflict with pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
