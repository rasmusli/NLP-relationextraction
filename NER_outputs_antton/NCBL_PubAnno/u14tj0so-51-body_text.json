For example , a pseudoknot - free structure has level 1 , and an H - type pseudoknot has level 2 . In another example , when representing the secondary structure in dot bracket format , the number of different brackets used to represent the structure is the level of the structure . IPknot can handle structures up to level 3 . \u2022 scoring model : The energy model used to produce posterior probabilities for each base pair is called \" scoring model \" . IPknot has 3 different scoring models , namely \" CONTRAfold \" , \" McCaskill \" and \" NUPACK \" . \u2022 refining parameters : The procedure of recalculating the base pair probabilities based on the original prediction results is referred to as \" refining parameters \" . \u2022 base pair weights for each level : Positive numbers representing the rate of true base pairs in each level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
