In the Control group , some GFAP - positive cells were detected , most of which were in the resting state ( Fig . 4B , panels a , d ) . Compared with the Control group , a significantly increased number of activated astrocytes , characterized by a large soma and fewer processes ( thus obtaining a more rounded shape ) , was observed in the white matter and amygdala of the LPS - treated offspring ( p < 0 . 05 and p < 0 . 001 , respectively ; Fig . 4B , panel b , e and 4D ) . To evaluate the hypertrophic soma , the cellular size of the astrocytes was also quantified by calculating the ratio of GFAP immunostained area to the number of GFAP - positive cells . Larger soma were observed in the white matter of LPS - exposed mouse brains ( p < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 4B , panel b and 4E ) . Although the number of GFAP - positive cells was unchanged following H 2 treatment , the size of the GFAP - positive cells was significantly reduced in the white matter ( p < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 4B , panel c and 4E ) , indicating a reduced number of reactive astrocytes by H 2 treatment . In the amygdala , the number of GFAP positive astrocytes in the HW + LPS group was significantly decreased ( p < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 4B , panel f and 4D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 724, "end": 737}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
