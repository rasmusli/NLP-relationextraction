However , the Ad - Cre adenovirus vector alone causes acute hepatitis in wild - type mice . Nevertheless , the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral protein ( serum ALT level over 2 , 000 IU / L ) [ 5 ] ; HCV core protein levels were reduced and expression of this protein was transient ( about 2 weeks ) . Therefore , this Ad - Cre - dependent model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to chronic HCV hepatitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 406}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 462, "end": 478}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 902}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
