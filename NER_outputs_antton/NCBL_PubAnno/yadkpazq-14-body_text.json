After 24 h incubation , supernatants were harvested by centrifugation of the cultures twice at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10 min , aliquoted and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0 C . Large supernatant quantities were produced with PBMCs purified after one blood collection , enabling the utilization of the same supernatants for virus inhibition experiments concerning VSV , FCV , FCoV , FHV and FPV . New supernatant batches were produced for use in FeLV inhibition assays . Supernatants derived from PBMCs stimulated with ODN 2216 , ODN 2243 and endotoxin - free PBS are referred to as Sup2216 , Sup 2243 and Sup Neg in the text and in the figures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
