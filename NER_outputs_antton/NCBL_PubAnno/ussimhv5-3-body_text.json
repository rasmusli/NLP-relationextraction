A novel FPLV strain was successfully isolated from these tigers . The tigers had been administered two doses of a vaccine ( Nobivac Tricat , Intervet ) against FPLV at three and four months of age . On 6 June 2016 , a 5 - month - old tiger presented with non - specific signs of infection , including fever , lethargy and anorexia . Subsequently , the tiger began to vomit and developed watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea later in the course of the disease , and transmitted the disease to nine additional tigers and lions ( all between five to eight months of age ) that were housed in the same or adjacent rooms . The animals failed to respond to antibiotic and supportive therapy , and five tigers died less than two days after the onset of diarrhea . The gross findings at necropsy in the tigers revealed diffuse fibrinous enteritis with dilatation of the intestine primarily affecting the ileum . The intestinal lumen contained a dense pinkish liquid with abundant epithelial debris and fibrin , as well as severe hemorrhagic enteritis with marked turgidity of the wall of the ileum . In addition , there was hemorrhaging and edema in the lungs , diffuse bleeding in the kidneys and bleeding spots and necrotic foci on the surface of the heart ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 62}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 174}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 462, "end": 468}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 479}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 492}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 558, "end": 579}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 910}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 966, "end": 994}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 999, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1198}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1288, "end": 1297}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1364, "end": 1373}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
