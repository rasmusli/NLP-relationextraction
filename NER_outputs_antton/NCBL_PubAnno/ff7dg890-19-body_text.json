One of the important tasks of any modeling exercise is to provide insights into some of the epidemiological characteristics of the invading infection , such as its transmissibility , virulence , and persistence dynamics . Of great interest is the estimation of the basic reproductive ratio of the infection ( R 0 ) , which measures the transmission potential of the infection , and determines the degree of control required .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 51}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
