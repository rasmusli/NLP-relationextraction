ST098 ; Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) . The bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1 mg / mL protease inhibitor cocktail ( catalog no . 11873580001 ; Roche , Penzberg , Germany ) , followed by mild sonication . Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation at 10 , [UNK] for 20 min . Subsequently , the soluble GST or GST - NS5A protein was incubated with the glutathione - Sepharose 4B resin for 4 h at 4 [UNK] C . The resins were washed four times with cold PBS and incubated with 300 \u00b5L of the lysate of the HEK293T cells transfected with pMyc - eEF1A for 2 h at 4 [UNK] C . After an extensive wash with PBS , the bound proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) followed by immunoblotting using the anti - Myc MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) ( catalog no . M4439 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and an anti - GST polyclonal antibody ( PAb ) ( 1 : 2000 ) ( catalog no . AB101 ; Tiangen , Beijing , China ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
