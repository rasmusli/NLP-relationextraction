{"cord_uid": "8gbktpt3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6950618", "divid": "46", "text": "Failure to vaccinate or inadequate or inappropriate vaccination in shelter - housed cats were major contributors to the re - emergence of FPL in Australia . Before these outbreaks , over half of the shelters from which cases were derived did not administer FPV vaccinations . In general , FPV vaccines are a highly effective tool in parvovirus control . For example , protective FPV antibody titres were measured in 95 % of vaccinated cats in a field study of adult cats after MLV vaccination , of which 64 % had pre - existing protective titres [ 35 ] . In addition , viral challenge studies of FPV - vaccinated cats usually show vaccine efficacy > 90 % [ 36 ] . Although state legislation mandates vaccination of owned cats in commercial boarding facilities in NSW and Victoria , vaccination is not enforced for cats admitted to private or municipal animal shelters , until they are sold for rehoming . Most shelters that did vaccinate , completed the primary course of vaccinations in kittens by 12 to 14 weeks of age and used inactivated vaccines , in contravention of the current guidelines . The World Small Animal Veterinary Association ( WSAVA ) Vaccination Guidelines recommend the use of MLV vaccines in shelter - housed cats for rapid induction of long - lasting humoral immunity [ 22 , 37 ] . A minimum age of 16 weeks for the final vaccination in the primary course is recommended , based on the failure of 45 % of kittens to seroconvert after vaccinations at 8 and 12 weeks of age with the commercial FPV MLV vaccination [ 37 , 38 ] . This immunity gap relates to persistent maternally derived antibodies ( MDA ) in kittens , which decline below protective titres yet effectively neutralize the vaccine virus and thereby prevent seroconversion [ 38 ] . Persistent MDA would explain the presence of vaccination non - responders in our study that were < 16 weeks of age at the time of diagnosis of FPL , highlighting that vaccination alone cannot prevent disease in environments where susceptible kittens are exposed to FPV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 138, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1910, "end": 1914}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
