The probability of vomiting declined during the course of the study , with a significant decline in cats fed Diet A in weeks 2 - 4 , with a 0 . 2 probability in the final week . Sixty seven percent ( n = 8 ) of the cats fed Diet A and 47 % ( n = 7 ) of the cats fed Diet B had no vomiting episodes at the final week of the study . Of these 15 cats , 3 showed an episodic pattern over the 4 - week period , with 1 or more weeks without vomiting followed by a later week with vomiting .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 181}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 506}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 691, "end": 700}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
