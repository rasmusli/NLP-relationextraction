The following day , the plates were washed with PBS and blocked for 2 h with PBST + 1 % BSA . Two hundred thousand splenocytes from immunised mice were added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0 C in 5 % CO 2 in the presence of media alone ( negative control ) , media with PMA / ionomycin ( positive control ) or media with peptide pools ( 1 \u03bcg / ml ) consisting of 15 - mers overlapping by nine amino acids and spanning the length of the ZIKV prME protein ( Genscript , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . After 24 h , the cells were washed and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0 C with biotinylated anti - mouse IFN - \u03b3 Ab ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) . Streptavidin - alkaline phosphatase ( R & D Systems ) was added to each well after washing and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature . The plate was washed , and then 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 \u2032 indolylphosphate p - toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride ( chromogen colour reagent ; R & D Systems ) was added . Last , the plates were rinsed with distilled water , dried at room temperature and SFU were quantified by an automated ELISpot reader ( CTL Limited , Shaker Heights , OH , USA ) , and the raw values were normalised to SFU per million splenocytes . For RM samples , the ELISPOT PRO for monkey IFN - \u03b3 kit ( MABTECH , Cincinnati , OH , USA ) was used as described by the manufacturer ; two hundred thousand PBMCs were stimulated with peptide pools ; and the plates were washed and spots were developed and counted as described before . 25 Humoral immune response : antibody - binding ELISA An ELISA was used to determine the titres of mouse and R sera as previously described . 25 Briefly , 1 \u03bcg of purified rZIKV - E protein was used to coat 96 - well microtiter plates ( Nalgene Nunc International , Naperville , IL , USA ) at 4 \u00b0 C overnight . After blocking with 10 % FBS in PBS for at least an hour , the plates were washed four times with 0 . 05 % PBST ( Tween20 in PBS ) . Serum samples from immunised mice and RMs were serially diluted in 1 % FBS , added to the plates , then incubated for 1 h at room temperature . The plates were again washed four times in 0 . 05 % PBST , then incubated with HRP - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( Sigma ) at a 1 : 35 , 000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature . For RM sera , anti - monkey IgG HRP ( Southern Biotech , Birmingham , AL , USA ) was used at a 1 : 5 , 000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature . The bound enzyme was detected by adding SIGMAFAST OPD ( o - phenylenediamine dihydrochloride ) substrate solution according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The reaction was stopped after 15 min with the addition of 1 N H 2 SO 4 . The optical density at 450 nm was read on a Synergy plate reader . All the mouse and RM serum samples were assayed in duplicate . Endpoint titres were determined using the method described by Frey et al . 27 Neutralisation ( PRNT 50 ) assay", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
