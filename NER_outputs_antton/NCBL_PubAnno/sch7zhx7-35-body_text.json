To this end , we treated Veros with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h . Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ) . In untreated cells , we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3 - 2A 29K , - 3C 52R , or double protease mutant . However , with DFMO treatment , eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection , as previously observed ( Figure 4A ) . When we analyzed DFMO - treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3 , we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G , significantly higher than wildtype CVB3 . In total , our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
