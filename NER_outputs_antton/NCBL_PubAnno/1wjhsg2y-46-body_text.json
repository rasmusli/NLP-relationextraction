While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen , we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host - pathogen dynamics [ 148 ] . Community ecology , with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities , allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi - pathogen , multi - host disease systems that occur across diverse scales ( e . g . , from within a single host , to between species , to between regions ) [ 148 ] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include : effects of extreme weather ( e . g . , heat waves ) on bat survival , including changes in the distribution of bat species ( and associated pathogens ) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [ 149 , 150 ] . For example , increased prevalence of Marburg virus ( MARV ) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition ( which resulted in an influx of immunologically - naive , juvenile bats ) , as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [ 77 ] . If such virus - host associations exist in regional bat species , climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats , and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations . A systems - wide , hypothesis - driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors , and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [ 146 , 148 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 863, "end": 874}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1477, "end": 1491}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
