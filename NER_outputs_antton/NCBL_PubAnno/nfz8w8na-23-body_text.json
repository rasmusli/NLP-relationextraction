Such avoidance and stigmatization is reported to have played out in several spaces , such as on public transit and other public spaces , and families advising children to avoid Chinese peers in school ( Jacobs 2007 ) . Some of the literature posits that this racialized stereotyping could have been prevented with denunciation from leaders in government and public health ( Jacobs 2007 ) . On the other hand , according to Ali ( 2008 ) , individualized health behaviors aimed at preventing SARS contraction - for instance , wearing a face mask - may have justified the avoidance of the stigmatized of the Asian - Canadians ( Ali 2008 ) . Culture and ethnicity functioned not only as a risk factor for discrimination but also as a facilitator in the response to the outbreak . The Chinese - Canadian community in Toronto employed numerous strategies to combat SARS and ease social anxieties , including fundraising for research , the dissemination of health promotion materials , and launching a SARS support line , among other activities ( Dong 2008 ) . The mobilization of spiritual leaders was also found to be an effective means of disseminating public health information ( Faust et al . 2009 ) . While it is important to recognize the contributions of cultural and ethnic groups , we assert that cultural and ethnic minority groups are more often targets of blame , as was the case for SARS in Toronto . Table 3 summarizes the total number of hits , and the number of papers that were retrieved and reviewed . The reviewed literature spoke to all of the themes identified in the politics of epidemics literature ( socioeconomic distribution of disease , credibility of evidence , and the attribution of infectious disease responsibility ) , with the exception of decision - making in research and development .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 35}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 745}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1114}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1245, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1640, "end": 1645}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1957, "end": 1976}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
