However , experiments have been equivocal in clarifying transmission mechanisms . Weanling bank voles caged with infected individuals lead to transmission as early as 14 days post exposure [ 14 ] . Similar experiments examining SNV transmission between deer mice have been less informative ; however , in artificial enclosure experiments , transmission appeared to be facilitated by deer mice with higher amounts of viremia and wounding [ 8 ] and males likely play a dominant role in transmission in natural populations [ 9 , 28 , 29 ] . In bank voles , offspring of PUUV - infected dams were less likely to be infected after exiting the nest because of protective maternal antibody [ 30 ] . Although it is thought horizontal transmission is most important , work by Hutchinson et al . [ 31 ] showed that vertical transmission occurred among cotton rats ( Sigmodon hispidus ) infected with Black Creek Canal virus , so it is possible that both routes may influence transmission at the population level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 794, "end": 812}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
