E i t represents the total energy consumption of fuel type i in year t ( in million tons , Mt ) , and NCV i is the net caloric value of fuel i . CC i t is the carbon content of the fuel type i , and O i is the oxidation rate of fuel i . The conversion factors , net caloric value , oxygenation efficiency and carbon content of the various fuels are listed in Table 4 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
