Mouse primary astrocytes were isolated from primary mixed glial - cell cultures of newborn ICR mice , as described previously 82 , 83 . The purity of the astrocytes was > 95 % , as determined by immunostaining with the anti - GFAP antibody . Astrocytes were plated at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells / well in 6 - well dishes . Cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s minimum essential medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 5 mg / ml bovine insulin , and 0 . 2 % glucose . To assess the expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines , confluent astrocytes were treated with 1 \u03bcg / ml LPS and / or HM . H 2 treatment was performed by replacing the astroglial medium with HM , and dehydrogenated HM was used as a control medium . The time course of H 2 concentration in HM was described previously 12 . Replacement of the astroglial medium with HM or control medium was performed 3 h before the addition of LPS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 509}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
