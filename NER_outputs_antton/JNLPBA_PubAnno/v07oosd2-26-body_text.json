In Table 1 , we have summarized the main results reported in the literature concerning fecal E . coli shedding and pig performance following oral CS treatment . Several studies have also followed histological ( i . e . intestinal mucosa morphology ) and biochemical ( e . g . d - lactate , nitric oxide , xylose , etc . ) parameters subsequent to CS use in the post - weaning period in pigs [ 78 , 79 ] . In order to evaluate the effect of colistin on fecal E . coli shedding , bacterial quantification was performed in most studies using culture methods [ 28 , 77 ] , whereas other studies used real - time PCR [ 79 , 80 ] . Furthermore , the oral use of a high dose of colistin in healthy piglets was not associated with a major perturbation in the pig gut microbiota as demonstrated by a high - throughput sequencing method [ 80 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
