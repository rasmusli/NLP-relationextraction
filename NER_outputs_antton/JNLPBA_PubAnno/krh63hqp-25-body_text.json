Regression analysis ( ANCOVA ) indicated a significant difference in the slope ( p = 0 . 0001 ) of the lines of best fit for the viruses obtained from the two species . Although it is clear that the swine versions have more variability towards the end of the sampling period , they also have a higher mutation rate in general , even after adjusting the human data for the 21 year period of dormancy .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
