In a previous report , IL34 \u2212 / \u2212 mice , which have significantly reduced development of microglia , are more susceptible to lethal infection after WNV - NS5 - E218A i . c . inoculation [ 36 ] . Similar to results reported here , IL34 \u2212 / \u2212 mice exhibited increased neuronal death compared with wildtype controls . In contrast with PLX5622 - treated mice , IL34 \u2212 / \u2212 mice exhibited similar levels of viral burden compared with wildtype controls in the brain at 3 and 6 dpi . Numbers of infiltrating monocytes / macrophages and WNV - specific T cells were also similar between IL34 \u2212 / \u2212 and wildtype controls ; however , the authors did not investigate antiviral T cell activation in this model [ 36 ] . In another model of flavivirus encephalitis , in which suckling mice were infected with dengue virus , depletion of microglia with liposome - encapsulated clodronate resulted in increased viral replication and reduced infiltration of IFN\u03b3 + CD8 + T cells [ 70 ] . Here , we report no reduction in CD8 + T cell infiltration ; however , this difference may be due to the age of mice , virus , and / or method of microglial depletion . Another recent study reported use of PLX5622 in a model of neuroattenuated murine corona virus , mouse hepatitis virus ( MHV ) . Similar to our results , PLX5622 treatment resulted in increased viral replication and lethality . In contrast to our results , PLX5622 treatment reduced expression of MHCII on microglia and macrophages and reduced CD4 + T cell response [ 60 ] . While CD4 + T cells can improve CD8 + T cell response , the dependence of CD8 + T cells on CD4 + T cells varies by virus , antigen exposure , tissue environment , and effector sites [ 71 ] . In models of MHV encephalitis , control of viral replication requires a collaborative effort between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 71 ] . However , when virus replication induces activation of APCs , activation of CD8 + T cells is relatively CD4 + T cell - independent [ 71 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1590, "end": 1596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1637, "end": 1641}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
