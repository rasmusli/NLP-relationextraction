Next , the cells were treated for an additional 24 h with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or fresh medium . Nocodazole induced obvious G2 / M cell cycle arrest ( 35 . 91 \u00b1 1 . 44 vs . 18 . 77 \u00b1 0 . 20 % ; P < 0 . 01 ) ; however , after EV - D68 infection for 24 h , the percentage of cells in G2 / M was decreased ( 21 . 82 \u00b1 1 . 07 vs . 35 . 91 \u00b1 1 . 44 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 was increased ( 48 . 59 \u00b1 1 . 22 vs . 32 . 51 \u00b1 0 . 21 ; P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 3D ) . Therefore , EV - D68 infection also regulates the cell cycle by promoting exit from G2 / M phase . Consistent with these findings , the expression of cyclinB1 and CDK1 ( which mediate G2 / M progression ; Coverley et al . , 2002 ; Yam et al . , 2002 ) was down regulated by EV - D68 infection ( Figures 3E , G ) . CDK1 was decreased at the mRNA level upon EV - D68 infection ( transition fromP < 0 . 01 ) , but cyclinB1 mRNA expression was not significantly regulated ( Figure 3F ) . Therefore , EV - D68 virus promotes cell cycle exit from G2 / M and entry into G0 / G1 by modifying the pathway of G0 / G1 entry at the transcriptional level for CDK1 and at the post - translational level for cyclinB1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 943, "end": 952}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 956, "end": 961}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1439, "end": 1444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1486, "end": 1495}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
