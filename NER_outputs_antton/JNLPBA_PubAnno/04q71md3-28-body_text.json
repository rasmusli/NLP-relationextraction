The XML file , airCommunitiesMM _ 1 . xml , specifies the data for one of the air community subsets as well as the model and MCMC settings . The empirical trees file required to run the analysis , subset1 . trees , contains a sample of 500 trees from the posterior distribution of the sequence analysis . ( ZIP ) Figure S1 Predictors of global H3N2 diffusion among the 14 air communities for three different sub - samples of the sequence data . Each combination of inclusion probability bar plot and corresponding coefficient plot represents the GLM results for one of the three different sub - samples of the H3N2 sequence data . These sub - samples were obtained by randomly down - sampling the four locations with the highest number of samples relative to their population size for each sampling year . The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E\u00bdd because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor . Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots . The contribution of each predictor , when included in the model ( bDd ~ 1 ) , where b is the coefficient or effect size , is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale . If the inclusion probability is zero for a predictor , no corresponding GLM coefficient is shown . We tested different population size and density measures , different incidencebased measures and different seasonal measures ( Text S1 ) , but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity . ( PDF ) Figure S2 Predictors of global H3N2 diffusion among the 14 air communities for the full data set and for two different sub - samples with a balanced number of sequences per location . Each combination of inclusion probability bar plot and corresponding coefficient plot represents the GLM results for the full data set ( A ) and the two different subsamples ( B and C ) of the H3N2 sequence data . These sub - samples were obtained by randomly down - sampling 25 sequences from locations for which the number samples available exceeded that number . The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E\u00bdd because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor . Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots . The contribution of each predictor , when included in the model ( bDd ~ 1 ) , where b is the coefficient or effect size , is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale . If the inclusion probability is zero for a predictor , no corresponding GLM coefficient is shown . We tested different population size and density measures , different incidence - based measures and different seasonal measures ( Text S1 ) , but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity . ( PDF ) Figure S3 Predictors of global H3N2 diffusion among the 14 air communities and the 15 & 26 geographic locations using equal prior probability on the inclusion and exclusion of each predictor . The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E\u00bdd because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor . As opposed the analysis reported in main manuscript ( Fig . 2 ) , which specifies a prior probability of 0 . 019 on each predictor ' s inclusion , we here specify a prior probability of 0 . 5 on the inclusion of each predictor . Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 3 and 20 are shown as a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots . The contribution of each predictor , when included in the model ( bDd ~ 1 ) , where b is the coefficient or effect size , is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale . NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the effect was never included in the model . We tested different population size and density measures , different incidence - based measures and different seasonal measures ( Text S1 ) , but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity . NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data . A comparison with the analysis reported in main manuscript ( Fig . 2 ) indicates that our results are robust to the prior specification for the inclusion probabilities ; only the scale of the Bayes factor support shifts to lower values because of the higher prior odds ( 1 : 1 as opposed to 0 . 019 : 0 . 981 ) in this case . ( PDF ) Figure S4 Net Markov jump counts for the 14 air communities . For each air community , we summarize the average net Markov jumps ( jumps to - jumps from ) and their 95 % credible intervals . The estimates are ordered from the lowest ( top ; jumps to , jumps from ) to highest ( bottom ; jumps to . jumps from ) net jumps . The data points are colored according to the air communities represented in Fig . 1 in the main text . ( PDF ) Figure S5 Correlation among observed H1N1 peaks and simulated peaks based on the BSSVS estimates . The Spearman rank correlation ( r ) and mean absolute error ( MAE ; in days ) for all locations except for Mexico is shown at the top left . The data points are colored according to the air communities represented in Fig . 1 in the main text .
