The CTS explicitly states whether a movement went through a market and , if so , which market was used . This allows us to construct networks that include markets as nodes . The above - listed sampling schemes can all be applied to this situation . There is significant uncertainty regarding the level of contact of animals from different batches ( farms ) on a market , and therefore the risk of transmission between animals during their stay on the market . For this reason , we investigate the effect of two extreme assumptions of transmission within a market ( electronic supplementary material , figure S3 ) . In the first scenario , we assume no within - market transmission , such that infection is only transmitted between the source and the destination farm . We assume complete segregation between herds being strictly enforced ( this would be equivalent to having no markets in the network ) . In the second scenario , we assume no segregation and no biosecurity at rspb . royalsocietypublishing . org Proc . R . Soc . B 282 : 20150205 a market , such that all batches that move through a market mix with one another homogeneously . In this case , we use the CTS data to determine which batches of cattle move through a market . When an infected batch moves to a market , that market becomes infected and we then assume that infection can be transmitted to all possible destination farms ( as determined based on the destinations of all batches that move from the market ) with an equal probability . A graphic depicting how the network is altered by the inclusion of markets is shown in the electronic supplementary material , figure S3 , and pseudo - code for the updated epidemic process is shown in the electronic supplementary material , algorithm 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
