The geranyl group made a suitable hydrophobic interaction with four aromatic residues : Phe353 , Trp354 , Phe460 and Tyr587 . Therefore Table 2 Structures and inhibitory activities ( IC 50 ) of flavonoid - based Cp - NanI inhibitors . of Ala292 and the side chains of Ile327 and Phe347 . On the other hand , eliminating the C3 0 hydroxyl group ( mimulone , IC 50 of 6 . 1 mM ) does not lead to structural clashes with the protein but prevents hydrogen - bond formation . Therefore , maintaining the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl group is important for the further development of diplacone - based Cp - NanI inhibitors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 488}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 531}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 869}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
