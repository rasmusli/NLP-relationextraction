Then the volume density of expiratory droplets v ( x , t ) can be calculated and the intake fraction can also be obtained by using Eq . ( 1 ) . Figure 5 shows the exposure levels of eighteen selected passengers from line 1 ~ 12 and seat A ~ F for case 1 ~ 3 , including seven passengers infected with SARS after the flight ( passenger 2C , 5E , 7D , 8E , 9B , 11B and 12B ) and eleven healthy passengers ( passenger 1D , 3E , 4C , 6D , 7 F , 8A , 9A , 10B , 10D , 11 F and 12C ) . The exposure level is demonstrated by the relative intake dose , which is the intake fraction of the passenger in each time step . The seating plan of the passengers can be found in Figure 1 . Figure 5 shows that the relative intake dose of each passenger is significantly different for different moving speeds . Even the passengers seated 8 rows ahead or 3 rows behind the index patient are affected by the movement . Hence the volume density distribution of expiratory droplets in the airplane cabin and the relative intake dose of each passenger can be significantly influenced by human movement . Figure 6 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 13 , respectively . Passengers who are seated close to the index patient ( especially for row 7 - 10 , seat D - F ) have much higher intake fractions than other passengers . The intake fractions of the passengers seated on the right side of the moving person ( seat D - F ) are slightly higher than that on the left side ( seat A - C ) . Lower intake fractions can be found from the passengers seated far away from the index patient ( row 1 - 4 ) . Comparing Figure 6 ( a ) ~ ( c ) , differences can be found in the intake fraction of every passenger . After human movement , more than half of the passengers will have higher intake fractions ( 41 passengers for case 2 and 38 for case 3 ) . Compared with case 1 , the variation range of the intake fractions is \u2212 91 % ~ + 472 % for case 2 and \u2212 99 % ~ + 255 % for case 3 . The average intake fraction of all the 71 seated passenger ( with the index patient and the moving person excluded ) is 1 . 69 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 , 1 . 75 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 and 1 . 91 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 for case 1 ~ 3 . That means the movement of the standing person may lead to a 3 . 3 % 9", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
