{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "2", "text": "Post - translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation are common molecular targets of conflict between viruses and their hosts . However , the role of other post - translational modifications , such as ADPribosylation , in host - virus interactions is less well characterized . ADP - ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP ( also called ARTD ) gene family . The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized . However , one PARP protein , PARP13 / ZAP , has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive ( diversifying ) selection in primates . Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic ' arms races ' with viral factors . To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host - virus interactions , we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution . Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in ' housekeeping ' functions , we found that nearly one - third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection . We identified a . 300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4 , a component of cytoplasmic vault structures , to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages , suggesting this region serves as an important host - pathogen specificity interface . We also found positive selection of PARP9 , 14 and 15 , the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains . Macrodomains uniquely recognize , and in some cases can reverse , protein mono - ADP - ribosylation , and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro - PARP macrodomains . Furthermore , PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution , consistent with recurrent gene innovation . Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity , as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion , our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition , recognition and removal of ADP - ribosylation is a critical , underappreciated currency in host - virus conflicts .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 507}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 714, "end": 728}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 764}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 877}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 969}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1050, "end": 1061}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1195, "end": 1224}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1403, "end": 1409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1438, "end": 1450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1468, "end": 1481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1485, "end": 1498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1500, "end": 1513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1683, "end": 1709}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1725, "end": 1732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1736, "end": 1743}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1926, "end": 1932}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1992, "end": 2021}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
