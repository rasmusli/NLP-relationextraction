While some practitioners are already using the approach we advocate [ 3 , 15 , 34 , 39 , 47 ] , the vast majority of applied epidemiological studies still use models that incorporate exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods . Perhaps this work points to the next steps in delivering quantitatively accurate epidemiological models .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
