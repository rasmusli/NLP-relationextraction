In the simplest case , how much is the risk of pneumonia following viral infection attributable to the presence of a known bacterial pneumonia pathogen ( such as S . pneumoniae ) in the URT ? To determine this , studies must examine timedependent carriage of bacteria , species - specific pneumonia outcomes and the effects of viral coinfection among other known risk factors - which , to the best of our knowledge , do not currently exist . Nonetheless , the literature strongly supports the presence of an interaction between viral infection and secondary bacterial pneumonia ; the failure to fully understand the mechanisms should act as a spur for future studies while continuing current efforts to reduce the worldwide burden of pneumonia .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
