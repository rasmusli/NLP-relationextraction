As an important evolutionary phenomenon , it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of biological systems from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [ 4 , 5 ] . Codon usage analysis has been applied to prokaryote and eukaryote , such as Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Caenorhabditis elegans and human beings [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . These observed patterns in synonymous codon usage varied among genes within a genome , and among genomes . The codon usage is attributable to the equilibrium between natural selection and mutation pressure [ 9 , 10 ] . Recent studies of viral codon usage has shown that mutation bias may be a more important factor than natural selection in determining codon usage bias of some viruses , such as Picornaviridae , Pestivirus , plant viruses , and vertebrate DNA viruses [ 9 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . Meanwhile , recent report also showed that the G + C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in iridovirus genomes [ 11 , 14 ] . Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution or individual genes of the viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1237, "end": 1256}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
