For i . c . inoculations of WNV - NY , virus strain 3000 . 0259 was passaged once in Vero cells to generate mammalian cell - derived stock . Attenuated WNV - NS5 - E218A was constructed from WNV 3356 strain as described previously [ 43 , 44 ] and was passaged once in Vero cells , as described previously [ 45 ] . Stock titers for all viruses were determined using BHK21 cells for viral plaque assay as previously described [ 46 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
