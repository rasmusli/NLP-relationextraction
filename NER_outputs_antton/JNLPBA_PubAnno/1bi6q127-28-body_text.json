Bats have superseded rodents in harboring greater number of viruses and also having greater proportion of zoonotic viruses [ 63 ] . It is therefore crucial to understand how evolutionary pressure may have a role in the emergence of new viral strains . A recent study found that henipavirus genomes are best adapted to pteropid bats [ 64 ] . Adaptation of genomes refers to better capability of the virus to use host cellular machinery for its replication and protein synthesis , which is usually governed by natural selection ; diversity in codon usage bias may contribute to it . Codon usage is an interspecies bias where one codon is selected over other synonymous codons in a particular species [ 65 ] . Natural selection for viral variants works by selecting codons matching host tRNA abundance . It also selects for variants with the advantage of not activating innate response genes , such as those for toll - like receptor 9 . Codon bias analysis suggested that henipaviruses have the highest level of adaptation to pteropid bats . It would be interesting to study whether other viruses also show such codon bias towards their reservoir hosts . We might be able to use such codon bias studies in the future to identify reservoir hosts of spilled over viruses . Due to coevolution with the reservoir host , the viruses would have a codon bias specific towards their reservoir host . Apart from codon bias , natural selection based on receptor utilization also has a role to play in the evolution of viruses . Variation in the efficiency of bat coronaviruses to recognize human receptors show that the viral spike protein evolved in a stepwise manner to infect human cells [ 66 ] . Despite several other receptor - binding studies [ 67 , 68 ] , the mechanism of adaptation to new hosts is not definitively understood .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 998, "end": 1020}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1040, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1708, "end": 1724}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1738, "end": 1758}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
