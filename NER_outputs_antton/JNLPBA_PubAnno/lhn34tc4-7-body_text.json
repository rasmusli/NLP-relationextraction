The findings of two recent retrospective studies of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic strongly suggest that it was non - pharmaceutical inventions such as quarantine and other social distancing measures that were most effective in slowing the rate of spread and minimizing the rate of death [ 8 , 9 ] . And data from SARS - affected regions have pointed to the enduring value and effectiveness of quarantine and other restrictive measures [ 10 , 11 ] .
