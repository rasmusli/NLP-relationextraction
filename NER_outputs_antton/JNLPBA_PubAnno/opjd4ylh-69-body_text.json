Even though the support structure is there in the hospital , their needs are not considered and attended to . A study by Mametja [ 16 ] reported concerns that were raised by nurses , that they needed counselling , not only when they have contracted the disease , but for them to cope with the demands of the high number of patients who no longer recover from the illness , but die as the result of HIV / AIDS . The findings of the present study agree with those of the study by Arjun [ 25 ] , which concluded that nurses caring for MDR - TB patients did not receive psychological support from the clinical psychologists when they need it ; neither was there a functional employee assistance programme available at the institution .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
