Spathulenol and \u03b4 - cadinene predominated in Teucrium brevifolia whereas carvacrol and caryophyllene oxide dominated in Teucrium montbretii . Such components revealed to be of great importance on the inhibition of NO production and , therefore , on the inflammation inhibition , since the main components of the remaining Teucrium species were caryophyllene and 4 - vinyl guaiacol in Teucrium flavum L . , and carvacrol and caryophyllene in Teucrium polium ssp . capitatum ( L . ) Arcangeli [ 137 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
