MDM were infected with replication competent HIV - 1 ( ADA at a multiplicity of infection , MOI , of 0 , 1 ) . Cells were washed and aliquots of the supernatant were harvested at different days post infection to monitor viral spread by exogenous - RT activity ( Figure 4C ) and cell lysates and virion particles were also harvested at the indicated times post infection . The intracellular levels of IFITMs increased over time during spreading HIV - 1 infection , in agreement with the upregulation of an IFNdependent transcriptional program described in a number of previous studies ( [ [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] ) , although not all ( [ 37 ] ) . As expected , when virion particles produced at different days after infection were examined , IFITMs were incorporated into HIV - 1 particles proportionally to their intracellular levels of expression . Of note , only a limited virus production was observed at day 3 post infection , as expected from the low levels of replication ongoing at this early time point . Virus production was however more robust at later time points , so that the intrinsic infectivity of virions produced from MDM at day 6 and 9 could be assessed after a MAGI assay on HeLaP5 cells . Under these conditions , virions obtained at day 6 displayed higher infectivity than viruses obtained at day 9 , in agreement with the higher incorporation of IFITMs in the latter .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 849, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1477, "end": 1484}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
