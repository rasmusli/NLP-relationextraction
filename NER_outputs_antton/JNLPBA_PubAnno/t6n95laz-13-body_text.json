In the field of CHB , proteomics is not widely performed , presumably due to the mechanism of CHB being so complicated . The aim of this study was to describe the changes in serum protein levels in patients with CHB and HBV - induced ACLF , respectively , compared with healthy controls using iTRAQ and western blotting . The authors hypothesized that this approach had the potential to ultimately be beneficial for the identification of proteins that were important in the progression of HBV infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 475}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
