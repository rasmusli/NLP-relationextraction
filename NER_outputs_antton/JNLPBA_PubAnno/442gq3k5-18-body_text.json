S . suis meningitis was diagnosed in 108 patients . Seven cases were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria . We also excluded 311 other patients as they did not meet the inclusion criteria for hospital controls ( Figure 2 ) . It was not possible to recruit community controls at the residency of one S . suis case because of the distance from the study site ( Central Viet Nam , 800 kms from Ho Chi Minh City ) . During the period of recruitment we therefore included 101 cases of confirmed S . suis meningitis , 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls for analysis ( Figure 2 ) . Patients were checked by nurses and doctors for skin injuries on forearms , hands and feet . Injuries were defined as lesions with signs of disruption of skin integrity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
