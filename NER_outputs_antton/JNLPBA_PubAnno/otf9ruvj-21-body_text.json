In 11 ( 38 % ) patients in the control group , bacterial pathogens such as Legionella ( n = 1 ; 3 % ) , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 1 ; 3 % ) , Pneumocystis jirovecii ( n = 3 ; 10 % ) , and E . coli ( n = 3 ; 10 % ) were identified in BAL samples . None of the control patients showed multidrug - resistant bacteria in any samples . In 28 % ( 8 of 29 ) of the control patients , a viral pathogen was detected in BAL samples : influenza ( n = 3 ; 10 % ) and herpes virus ( n = 6 ; 21 % ) . Herpes virus infection included HSV ( n = 5 ; 17 % ) and CMV ( n = 2 ; 7 % ) . Herpes viral infection was confirmed by cell - based culture . In five of the control patients , fungal infection was diagnosed via blood culture ( n = 1 ) , abdominal sample ( n = 2 ) , and BAL ( Aspergillus , n = 2 ) . In nine control patients , no causal pathogen could be identified ( 31 % ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
