The ZIKV - prME consensus sequence was cloned into the pVax1 vector after additional modifications and optimisations were made to improve its in vivo expression including the addition of a highly efficient immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) leader peptide sequence ( Figure 1a ) . Optimal alignment of ZIKV - Env sequences was performed using homology models and visualisation on Discovery Studio 4 . 5 . Reference models included PDB 5JHM and PDB 5IZ7 . Aligned residues corresponding to specific regions on the prME antigen were labelled in the models for visualisation purposes ( Figure 1b ) . The optimised consensus vaccine selections are , in general , conservative or semi - conservative relative to multiple ZIKV strains analysed in this study . Structural studies of EDE - specific neutralising antibodies have revealed that these recognition determinants can be found at a serotype - invariant site at the Env - dimer interface , which includes the exposed main chain of the fusion loop and two conserved glycan chains ( N67 - and N153linked glycans ) . 15 These two glycosylation sites are not highly conserved in other flaviviruses . Moreover , ZIKV does not possess the N67 - linked glycosylation site , and the N154 - linked glycosylation site ( equivalent to the N153 - linked glycosylation site in dengue ) is absent in some of the isolated ZIKV strains . As part of the consensus design , we therefore designed the construct leaving out this glycosylation site . Lack of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type broadly neutralising antibodies ( bnAbs ) to ZIKV - Env protein . 15 Subsequent to construction , expression of the ZIKV - prME protein from the plasmid was confirmed by western blot analysis and an indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) . The protein extracts prepared from the cells transiently transfected with ZIKV - prME were analysed for expression by western blot using a panflavivirus antibody ( Figure 1c ) and sera collected from ZIKV - prME immunised mice ( Figure 1d ) . ZIKV - prME expression was further detected by IFA by the staining of 293T cells transfected Figure 1 . Construction of the ZIKV - prME consensus DNA vaccine . ( a ) Diagrammatic representation of the ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine indicating the cloning of prME into the pVax1 mammalian expression vector . A consensus design strategy was adopted for the ZIKV - prME consensus sequence . Codon - optimised synthetic genes of the prME construct included a synthetic IgE leader sequence . The optimised gene construct was inserted into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of a modified pVax1 vector under the control of the CMV promoter . ( b ) Model building of the ZIKV - E proteins demonstrates overlap of the vaccine target with potentially relevant epitope regions . Several changes made for vaccine design purpose are located in domains II and III ( located within dashed lines of inset , middle left ) . Vaccine - specific residue changes in these regions are shown in violet CPK format on a ribbon backbone representation of an E Env protein dimer ( each chain in light and dark green , respectively ) . Regions corresponding to the defined EDE are indicated in cyan , and the fusion loop is indicated in blue . Residue Ile156 ( T156I ) of the vaccine E protein , modelled as exposed on the surface of the 150 loop , is part of an N - linked glycosylation motif NXS / T in several other ZIKV strains as well as in multiple dengue virus strains . ( c and d ) Expression analysis by SDS - PAGE of ZIKV - prME protein expression in 293T cells using western blot analysis . The 293T cells were transfected with the ZIKV - prME plasmid and the cell lysates and supernatants were analysed for expression of the vaccine construct with pan - flavivirus ( c ) or Sera from ZIKV - prME immunized mice ( d ) . Protein molecular weight markers ( kDa ) ; cell lysate and supernatant from ZIKV - prME transfected cells and rZIKV - E positive control were loaded as indicated . ( e ) Immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) analysis for ZIKV - prME protein expression in 293T cells . The cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcg of the ZIKV - prME plasmid . Twenty - four hours post transfection , immunofluorescence labelling was performed with the addition of sera ( 1 : 100 ) from ZIKV - prME immunised mice followed by the addition of the secondary anti - mouse IgG - AF488 antibody for detection . Staining with sera from ZIKV - prME and pVax1 immunised mice is shown . DAPI panels show control staining of cell nuclei . Overlay panels are combinations of antimouse IgG - AF488 and DAPI staining patterns .
