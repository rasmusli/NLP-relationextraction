Fifty female blow flies ( Kyoto strain C . nigribarbis ) , approximately 14 days old , were put into a 20 cm 3 fly cage for 3 h at 20 \u2022 C with a piece of cotton impregnated with 10 8 EID 50 / mL allantoic fluid from an H5N1 virus ( A / duck / Hyogo / 35 / 2001 [ 10 ] ) - infected egg diluted with MEM diluents [ 11 ] . Following the 3 h virus exposure , the blow flies were individually reared at 20 \u2022 C or 10 \u2022 C until tested . Incubation at 10 \u2022 C was chosen because the average temperature around Tamba Town was 3 . 6 \u2022 C in February and 6 . 4 \u2022 C in March , with average daytime highs of 11 . 1 \u2022 C in February and 13 . 1 \u2022 C in March [ 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
