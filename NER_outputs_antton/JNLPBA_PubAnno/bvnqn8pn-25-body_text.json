A history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6 - 20 years [ 19 ] . Acute asthma exacerbations are largely preventable [ 2 ] , and so are ED visits and hospitalizations for this reason [ 9 , [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . In the United States , there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden , such as school - based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines , but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that , despite these measures , the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for asthma did not change significantly over time [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
