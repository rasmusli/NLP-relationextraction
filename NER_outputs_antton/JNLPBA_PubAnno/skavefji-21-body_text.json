Neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid was frequently found in patients with bacterial - and viral pneumonia . The degree of pleocytosis , which was higher in the bacterial pneumonia , was useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia . Total WBC count had the best diagnostic accuracy for predicting bacterial pneumonia , and its diagnostic performances was better than those of serum procalcitonin and C - reactive protein concentrations . Combinations of BAL fluid total WBC count , serum procalcitonin concentration , and serum C - reactive protein concentration provided the best diagnostic yields . The data suggest that cellular analysis of BAL fluid is a rapid and useful technique for differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia , and can be used to direct early appropriate treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 661}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 681, "end": 708}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
