The current enhancement of the health impact assessment with the above described mass - balance approach to account for variable ventilation is built on the previous achievements of EnVIE [ 19 ] and IAIAQ projects [ 20 ] and the corresponding models for environmental burden of disease caused by indoor air quality . These models were based on a predefined population attributable burden of disease ( BoD ) for each exposure and disease and national estimates are then calculated from the national burden of disease data by scaling the attributable fraction according to the ratio of national versus European - 8 - indoor concentration estimates of each pollutant . ( i . e . PM 2 . 5 , outdoor bioaerosols , VOC , carbon oxide ( CO ) radon and dampness ) . In the current work the earlier PM 2 . 5 , radon and dampness models were updated to the relative risk - based population attributable fraction ( PAF ) approach but keeping the IAIAQ disease classification . In addition , second hand smoke exposures at home were added using exposure data from a European survey [ 21 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
