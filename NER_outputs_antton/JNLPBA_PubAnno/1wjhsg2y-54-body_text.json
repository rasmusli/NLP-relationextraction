{"cord_uid": "1wjhsg2y", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6466127", "divid": "54", "text": "In this review , we summarize the current knowledge of bats as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses that jeopardize public health and food security , yet are threatened by a multitude of human activities that alter host - virus dynamics . We highlight that Western Asia is a region with a diverse bat fauna comprising 96 species that overlap at the biogeographic crossroads of Asia , Oceania , Africa , and Europe . Through literature searches based on key terms in PubMed , we demonstrate that research on bats and bat - associated viruses is highly fragmented across the region , and severely limited in most countries . Challenges due to political instability and resource availability in some Western Asian countries has likely contributed to this limited research effort on bats and their viruses . We propose that collaborative scientific research - notably a regional bat research network , the Western Asia Bat Research Network ( WAB - Net ) - could have the ability to rise above such challenges when faced with a common goal and driven by strong network engagement with a mission toward sustainability . The WAB - Net will facilitate cross - border research cooperation to guard against threats posed by humans that jeopardize bat populations and promote zoonotic disease outbreaks , and will serve as a model for the development of additional research networks to study host - virus dynamics in other taxa native to Western Asia , in particular known reservoirs of zoonotic diseases ( e . g . , rodents in Iran [ 155 ] ) . We strongly advocate a \" bats for peace \" mission for WAB - Net by promoting data sharing and a culture of meaningful transboundary scientific collaboration to develop a sustainable bat research network and serve as an instrument for the early detection of zoonotic disease threats in this politically volatile region .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 897, "end": 931}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1113, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1583, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
