The importance of respiratory infectious agents , both viruses ( e . g . , respiratory syncytial virus , rhinovirus , metapneumovirus , parainfluenza virus , and coronavirus ) and bacteria ( e . g . , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) , in the development of asthma exacerbations has been stressed by several authors [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . The role of infections in acute wheezing is even more evident in the first years of life . Indeed , our results highlight that almost all the wheezing preschool - aged children had an underlying respiratory illness . On the other hand , one - third of the children aged 6 or more had an asthma exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger , whereas in 10 % the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit . In fact , several agents can elicit acute asthma : respiratory tract infections , environmental allergens , pollutants , and stress [ 14 , 15 ] . Moreover , synergistic interactions between these factors might also very likely play a role [ 14 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
