Nurses indicated their emotional distress due to fear of contagion , lack of material resources , as well as poor infection control practices . The Occupational Health and Safety Act stipulates measures and standards of practice , however such standards are jeopardized by inadequate financial and resource allocation in the public sector . Nurses expressed the need for in - service education and support by managers . Managers must ensure that nurses have resources to maintain quality nursing care and receive social and psychological support as they face death on a daily basis . While available resources are limited , there is a need to direct resources to the problem , to improve quality of services in the TB wards .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
