The odds of Bartonella infection were highest for vampire bats with larger forearms ( OR = 1 . 2 , p < 0 . 001 ) and for males ( OR = 5 . 41 , p < 0 . 01 ) , were marginally higher for non - reproductive individuals ( OR = 2 . 36 , p = 0 . 10 ) , and did not differ between subadult and adult bats ( OR = 1 . 58 , p = 0 . 38 ) ; our sample did not contain juveniles . Individual bat fly intensities were highly variable ( 0 - 28 , median = 7 . 5 ) and showed overdispersion ( [UNK] = 5 . 08 in an intercept - only quasi - Poisson GLM ) . The bat fly GLMs showed that neither ectoparasite intensity ( OR = 0 . 98 , p = 0 . 81 ) nor ectoparasite presence ( \u03c7 2 = 1 . 13 , p = 0 . 29 ) were associated with Bartonella infection status . We note that the majority of infected bats in this sample were infested with at least one bat fly ( 31 / 36 ) , limiting conclusive assessment of the ectoparasite - infection relationship . Our multivariable quasi - Poisson GLM showed that ectoparasite load did not vary by bat sex ( \u03c7 2 = 0 . 86 , p = 0 . 35 ) or bat age ( \u03c7 2 = 0 . 09 , p = 0 . 77 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
