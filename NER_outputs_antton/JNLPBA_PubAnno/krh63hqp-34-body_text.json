Yet , globally human H1N1 influenza is monophyletic and all current variation is of recent origin . This is only possible if almost all human influenza lineages rapidly go extinct . Moreover , we present strong evidence that the H1N1 genome has been systematically degenerating since 1918 . This is evidenced by continuous , systematic , and rapid changes in the H1N1 genome throughout its history . For example , there was an especially rapid and monotonic accumulation of mutations during a single pandemic ( Figure 1 ) . Similarly , there was a continuous and rapid accumulation of mutations over the entire history of the virus ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , including a similar steady increase in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions ( Figure 3 ) . While mutations accumulated in the human H1N1s , there was a parallel accumulation of mutations in the porcine H1N1 lineage ( Figure 4 ) . Fitch , et al . [ 36 ] also showed a linear mutation accumulation curve . The \" gnarled trunk \" of Ito , et al . [ 42 ] should be buried in our data as well , but it will be swamped by the pervasive , genome - wide accumulation of mutations not under active selection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 539}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
