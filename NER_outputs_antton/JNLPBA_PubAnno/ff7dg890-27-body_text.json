It is much more effective when the infectious period is exponentially distributed because it essentially truncates the tail of the distribution , so that the infectious period of a few individuals is dramatically reduced . This effect is not as pronounced in the gamma - distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods ( see Figure 1A ) . In the same way , a longer delay in detecting infected individuals has fewer consequences for the exponentially distributed model because during this time many individuals will have naturally left the infectious class . Under the assumption of a gamma - distributed infectious period most individuals are infectious for a minimum period of time so early detection is ( C ) We plot the incidence data along with the SEIR best fit ( m \u00bc 2 , n \u00bc 2 ) and that obtained by ignoring any latent period ( n \u00bc 1 ) - the SIR best fit . ( D ) The best - fit estimate of R 0 changes for these two models as we increase the number of points used in the fitting procedure . When fitting the models , for each value of n ( and m ) , we are estimating the average infectious period , 1 / c , and transmission parameter , b ( and average latent period , 1 / r ) . The effective population size for the influenza outbreak was known to be N \u00bc 763 . DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 0020174 . g003 more important . While the predicted difference between the exponential and gamma - distributed models depends on the duration of the infectious period and the fraction of contacts traced , it is generally true that models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will give rise to overly optimistic predictions concerning the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 909}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1004}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
