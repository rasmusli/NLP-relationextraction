HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV - 1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [ 52 , 53 ] . The cells were infected with either T - cell ( X4 ) - or macrophage ( R5 ) - tropic HIV - 1NL4 - 3 standardized for equal amounts of p24 . Following permanent ( up to 15 days post infection ) or structured treatment ( only day 1 and 3 post infection ) with increasing concentrations of the DIs PR - 619 or P22077 , cell culture supernatants were collected on the indicated days post infection ( dpi ) and analyzed for release of virus particles by measuring the virus associated reverse transcriptase ( RT ) activity ( Figure 4A ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 852, "end": 874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 876, "end": 879}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
