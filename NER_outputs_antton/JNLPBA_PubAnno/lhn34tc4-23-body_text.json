On the ' Justification ' sub - scale , female respondents scored significantly higher than males [ F = 11 . 456 ( df = 1 ) , p < . 001 ] , thereby indicating greater agreement that the use of quarantine is justified in the context of an infectious disease outbreak . With respect to age , older respondents ( > 65 yrs ) indicated greater agreement that use of quarantine is justified than did the young ( 18 - 35 yrs ) [ F = 4 . 514 ( df = 2 ) , p < . 01 ] . Also , older respondents agreed more strongly that the use of sanctions for quarantine absconders is appropriate when compared both with the young and with the middle - aged ( 36 - 65 yrs ) [ F = 4 . 577 ( df = 2 ) , p < . 01 ] . There were no significant differences by region .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
