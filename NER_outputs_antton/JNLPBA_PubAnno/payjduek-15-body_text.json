The clinical symptoms and signs resolved without KD specific therapy , with no coronary artery complications detected on follow up . KD is an acute vasculitic syndrome of unknown etiology , occurring mainly in children [ 13 ] . As there are no confirmatory tests , the diagnosis of KD is made based on the presence of fever lasting for 5 days or more , and 4 of 5 principal clinical criteria that include conjunctivitis without exudates , cervical lymphadenopathy , polymorphous rash , changes in the lips or oral mucosa , and changes of the extremities [ 13 ] . A major challenge in the diagnosis and management of KD , however , is the recognition that some infants present with only 2 - 3 clinical features , and therefore do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria . Laboratory investigations may be of some use in this situation of incomplete KD [ 13 ] . BCG reactivation has repeatedly been described as an important sign in incomplete KD , although it is not included in any of the diagnostic algorithms [ 14 , 15 ] . For example , in South Korea , 85 % of children aged < 1 year who were diagnosed with incomplete KD had erythema , induration or crust formation at the BCG inoculation site [ 16 ] . The unexpected finding of BCG reactivation in our patient correctly raised the concern of a possible diagnosis of incomplete KD . Although echocardiography was not performed in the initial phase , no additional supporting clinical or laboratory criteria , other than mild anemia , were found . Reassuringly , the rapid resolution of symptoms precluded any further concerns with regard to the need for KD therapy in the patient .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 997}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1366, "end": 1370}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
