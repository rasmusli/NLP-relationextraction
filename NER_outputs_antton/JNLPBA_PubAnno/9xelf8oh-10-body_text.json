BLASTn ( Altschul et al . 1990 ) was used to align gene sequences for the endogenous control candidates , using sequence data from the mouse ( Mus musculus ) and the 13lined ground squirrel ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) , the only available genome from the Sciuridae family ( GenBank Accession number AGTP01000001 - 01024510 ) ( Benson et al . 2010 ) . Conserved regions between the mouse and 13lined ground squirrel were assumed to be good candidates for sequence conservation between red and grey squirrels . Those conserved regions were then sequenced to investigate their suitability to amplify host DNA in a qPCR ( as described in Online Resource S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
