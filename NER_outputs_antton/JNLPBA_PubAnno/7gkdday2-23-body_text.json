RT - qPCR method was adopted to detect a panel of 10 different respiratory viruses . About 79 % ( 158 / 200 ) of enrolled ARI patients were laboratory - confirmed for viral infections with either single viral infections ( 54 . 5 % ; n = 109 ) or infections with more than one viruses ( 24 . 5 % ; n = 49 ) . Although the number of viral infected patients was 158 , the total number of virus detected in this study Modified disc diffusion method was used for profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility / resistance . Bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of the inhibition zone interpretative , as manifested by CLSI .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
