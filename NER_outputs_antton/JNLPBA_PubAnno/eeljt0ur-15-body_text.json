There was no correlation between the frequency of vomiting or diarrhea over the 4 - week period and the presence of fecal enteropathogens detected via PCR or antibody testing ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Similarly , neither Spec fPL results nor age of the cat correlated with the frequency of vomiting over the 4 - week period ( p > 0 . 05 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
