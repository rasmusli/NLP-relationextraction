With 4 . 17 / 1 ( T1 ) and 5 . 46 / 1 ( T2 ) , the ratio of DWV type - B to type - A was similar to the one in the feeding pupae ( 5 . 88 / 1 for DWV - B to DWV - A ) . Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the identity of both DWV strains found in M . rubra ( GenBank accession : DWV - A , JF346565 . 1 , 99 . 73 % identity , 100 % query cover ; DWV - B , AY251269 . 2 , 98 . 84 % identity , 99 % query cover ) . The viral titers found in ants were in the range of 6 . 46 - 9 . 66 with a log mean of 7 . 95 \u00b1 0 . 72 for T1 , 6 . 17 - 10 . 18 , 8 . 26 \u00b1 1 . 02 for T2 , and 3 . 17 - 5 . 88 , 4 . 22 \u00b1 0 . 85 in the control group seen over all weeks ( Figure 1 , Table 2 ) . Viral titers in ants were significantly affected by the factors treatment ( X 2", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
