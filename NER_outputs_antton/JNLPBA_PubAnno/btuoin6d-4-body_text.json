Respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of hospitalization of military trainees in the medical field . A study by the US military showed that 10 % of recruits at boot camp were infected with Adv , and 90 % of patients with pneumonia were infected with adenovirus [ 10 , 11 ] . In 2006 , a study by the South Korean military reported that the prevalence of Adv was 61 % among military recruits with acute respiratory symptoms [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] . Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Adv may also progress to pneumonia . Recently , several case series were reported describing recruits that died in boot camp due to severe adenoviral pneumonia in South Korea since 2012 [ 13 , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] . Even if mortality results or clinical outcome of Adv infection could be affected by selection bias , it has been reported that Adv infection may be severe with a higher incidence of progression to respiratory and multiorgan failure compared to other viral etiologies with the exception of influenza . Thus , some clinical data have been reported regarding predictive factors of respiratory failure associated with Adv infection [ 18 , 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
