We sought to determine the role of CSF1R signaling in viral clearance of both systemic and neurotropic infection . Our results indicate that antagonism of CSF1R signaling limits virologic control within the CNS via reduction of critical APCs that express co - stimulatory B7 molecules , CD80 and CD86 , necessary ( See figure on previous page . ) Fig . 4 CSF1R antagonism reduces response of APCs in peripheral immune compartments following peripheral infection with WNV - NY . Mice were fed PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks , then infected via f . p . with WNV - NY ( 100 PFU ) . At 4 dpi , leukocytes were isolated from blood ( a - j ) and draining popliteal LNs ( k - t ) . a , k Representative flow cytometry plots of CD11c expression on CD45 + - gated cells and b , l fluorescence minus one ( FMO ) gating controls . c , m Quantification of percentages and d , n total numbers of CD11c + CD45 + cells . e , o Representative flow cytometry plots of MHCII + expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells . f , p Quantification of percentages and g , q total numbers of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells . h Representative flow cytometry plots of CD86 + expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells . i Quantification of percentages and j total numbers of CD86 + CD11c + CD45 + cells . r Representative flow cytometry plots of CD80 + expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells . s Quantification of percentages and t total numbers of CD80 + CD11c + CD45 + cells .

Data shown represent analysis from one experiment with three to five mice per group .

For all data : ns , not significant at P < 0 . 05 ; * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 for local reactivation of antiviral CD8 + T cells . Our data also indicate that CSF1R antagonism reduces expression of co - stimulatory B7 molecules on peripheral APCs , contributing to loss of virologic control in the periphery and dissemination of virus to the CNS . As previously reported , WNV - NY inoculated into mice via f . p . is detected first within the olfactory bulb then spreads caudally through the cerebral cortex to the brain stem with significant virus not detected in the cerebellum until 8 dpi [ 20 ] . CSF1R antagonism with PLX5622 leads to increased viral replication within each of these CNS regions and also in the peripheral organs : the spleen , kidney , and serum .

MFI quantifications are shown as arbitrary units ( AU ) by normalizing each sample to the MFI of FMO negative control value [ 77 ] . For quantification panels , each symbol represents an individual control - ( black ) or PLX5622 - treated ( red ) mouse , and bars indicate mean \u00b1 SEM . Data presented are the compilation of two independent experiments with seven to nine mice per group . Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t tests with Welch ' s correction . For all data : ns , not significant at P < 0 . 05 ; * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 contrast to CNS titers , the virus is cleared from the spleen and serum by 8 dpi in WNV - infected , control , and PLX5622 - treated mice . Notably , we detected expansion of viral tropism with significant viral replication in the kidney of PLX5622 - treated mice at 4 and 6 dpi compared with control - treated animals . These data suggest that renal macrophages may be sensitive to CSF1R antagonism , which is consistent with a study utilizing a model of recovery from acute kidney injury in which CSF1R inhibition with GW2580 reportedly decreased both kidney macrophage proliferation and their polarization towards wound - healing phenotypes [ 62 ] . In order to better isolate the role of microglia during neurotropic infection , we examined the effect of PLX5622 in an established murine model of CNS infection using an attenuated strain of WNV ( WNV - NS5 - E218A ) , which lacks 2 \u2032 - O - methyltransferase activity , thus increasing sensitivity to IFIT - mediated suppression and limiting virulence in peripheral organs with intact immunity [ 8 , 45 , 49 ] . Mice infected i . c . with WNV - NS5 - E218A exhibited increased viral titers in the CNS and increased lethality with PLX5622 treatment compared with control treatment . These data suggest that loss of CNS immunity increases lethality of WNV infection . Clearance of WNV within the CNS requires local reactivation of antiviral CD8 + T cells for efficient T cell - mediated adaptive immune responses [ 55 , 63 ] . Under homeostatic conditions , microglia express very low levels of co - stimulatory B7 molecules ( CD80 / CD86 ) ; however , microglia upregulate expression of these molecules in response to inflammatory cytokines [ 54 , 64 ] . Our results show PLX5622 treatment decreased expression of these molecules by depleting their cellular sources in the CNS , which include both resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes / macrophages . In the periphery , PLX5622 also reduced cellular expression of B7 molecules on splenic , blood , and pLN APCs . Under certain conditions , other co - stimulatory molecules are able to compensate for the loss of B7 signals in T cell reactivation . For example , expansion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus - specific antiviral T cells can be driven by either alternative co - stimulatory TNFR superfamily members or by enhanced expression of antiviral cytokines , such as high levels of type I IFNs [ 65 ] . However , during WNV encephalitis , PLX5622 treatment also significantly decreased transcriptional expression of both TNF and IFN\u03b2 . Together , our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism contributes impaired local reactivation of antiviral T cells within the CNS by depleting co - stimulatory signals including both B7 molecules and inflammatory cytokines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 90}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 431}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 555}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 557, "end": 562}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 631}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 995, "end": 1001}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1226, "end": 1232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1406, "end": 1411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1576, "end": 1581}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
