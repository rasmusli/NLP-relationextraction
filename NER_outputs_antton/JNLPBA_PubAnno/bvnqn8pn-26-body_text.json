Half of them were in the school age , meaning that they were the real asthmatics of the case series , according to what is previously described by Stein and Martinez [ 23 ] . For them , the chance of needing hospitalization was higher than their peers with no previous asthma diagnosis . Among this group of older children with known asthma , up to 2 / 3 were not using controller medications , either for no prescription or for low compliance , and , according to our results , were at higher risk of a moderatesevere exacerbation than those using it . Controller medications are indicated in children with persistent asthma , and their correct use has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for asthma [ 21 , 24 ] . Evaluating asthma severity was beyond the goals of our study ; thereby we cannot say how many of the 63 asthmatic children aged over 5 years and not using long - term controller therapy would have had a real need of such a prescription . However , the fact that so many asthmatic children were not using controller therapy , although our National Health System provides a pediatricsspecialized general practitioner for all children until the age of 14 , seems to point out the need for an improvement in the territorial network of asthma management .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
