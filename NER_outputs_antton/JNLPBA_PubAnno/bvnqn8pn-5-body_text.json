In the preschoolers ( 0 - 5 years old ) , acute wheeze is often induced by infections of the lower airways , whereas in the school - aged children ( 6 years and older ) it usually signifies underlying asthma [ 6 ] and allergy . These differences account for specific seasonal patterns in the number of ED visits for asthma . In the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere , a peak in exacerbations is described in the month of September : this well - known entity is called the \" September asthma epidemics , \" coincides with the start of the school year , and is likely due to a combination of infectious , allergic , environmental , and climatic triggers [ 7 ] . Understanding the seasonal variations of ED visits due to asthma may have important therapeutic implications in terms of a proactive treatment of at - risk subjects .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
