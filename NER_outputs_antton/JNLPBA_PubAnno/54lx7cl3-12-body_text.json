Similar to S . pneumoniae , M . catarrhalis is a primary carriage species estimated to colonize between 31 % and 50 % of children < 2 years in the USA [ 45 ] and frequently causes URT infections , such as acute otitis media . However , unlike S . pneumoniae , M . catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia [ 46 ] , suggesting that differences in mechanisms of pathogenicity may be the explanation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
