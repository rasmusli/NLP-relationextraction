This difference is surprising given that both EV - A71 and EV - D68 belong to the Picornaviridae family . To further confirm the different activities between the two viruses , we analyzed them side by side , and our results confirm that G0 / G1 synchronization promotes EV - D68 viral production but inhibits EV - A71 viral production . Therefore , EV - D68 an EV - A71 can both manipulate the host cell cycle , but the process and outcomes of cell cycle manipulation are entirely different , which could explain why EV - D68 and EV - A71 have varying characteristics , such as the epidemic region ( Europe and Asia ) , the clinical symptoms , and the epidemic size . Meanwhile , these results serve as a reminder that different enteroviruses may require different therapeutic treatments targeting a different set of host factors . Unfortunately , the reason of the difference between them is not clear , but it is speculated that some a host factor ( s ) generated or kept high level in G0 / G1 phase was required by EV - D68 production , while EV - A71 required some a host factor ( s ) generated or kept high level in S phase so that their non - structural 3D were obligated by two viruses to regulate host cell cycle for their own replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1023, "end": 1036}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1144, "end": 1156}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1277, "end": 1289}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
