Borneol , camphor , \u03b1 - terpineol , 1 , 8 - cineole , camphene , \u03b1 - pinene and p - cymene constituted the major compounds of these essential oils in different relative amounts . The oils in which thymol or carvacrol predominated did not present significant activities , which according to the authors [ 53 ] indicated that these phenolic compounds are not determinant in the ability for scavenging hydroxyl radicals .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
