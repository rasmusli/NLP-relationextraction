The virological findings from these cases yet again highlight the difficulty of diagnosing FPL in cats that have recently received MLV vaccines , as well as raising important questions about the potential capacity of reversion to virulence of MLV vaccines . The diagnosis of FPL in cases from NZ was initially based on consistent clinical signs and a positive faecal antigen test . Point - of - care immunochromatographic assays designed to detect CPV faecal antigen also detect FPV , so are used in practice for the diagnostic investigation of cats with clinical signs consistent with FPL [ 22 ] . However , faecal antigen tests detect both field and vaccine strains of FPV and CPV . In one study evaluating three commercial CPV faecal antigen kits , 20 % of cats vaccinated against FPV in the preceding 14 days returned positive test results [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
