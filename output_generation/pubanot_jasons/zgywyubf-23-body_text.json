In an infected cell , by default , pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the MHC class I molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells . This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection . Thus , it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step . In fact , downregulation of MHC class I both at transcriptional and post - translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . Since NF - \u03baB is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class I molecules in the infected cell , inhibition of the NF - \u03baB activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage ; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
