The largest influenza peaks occurred in winter from December to February in the first two years , but we also isolated influenza during the monsoon period . A summer outbreak of influenza has previously been reported from Nepal [ 39 ] . Surveillance data from 2007 at the Kathmandu sentinel site has showed that InfB was prevalent throughout the year except in May , and that InfA prevailed during June to August and reappeared in December [ 40 ] . Unlike in temperate regions , where influenza occurs in well - defined outbreaks lasting 2 to 3 months once a year in the winter , influenza is detectable for a greater part of the year in tropical and sub - tropical regions and the timing of outbreaks is less predictable [ 41 , 42 ] . Influenza peaks have been reported to occur during periods of high rainfall in many tropical locations [ 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
