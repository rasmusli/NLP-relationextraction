The adjustment of industrial structure in Guangzhou was mainly focused on upgrading the traditional advantage industries ( i . e . iron and steel , shipbuilding , machinery and equipment , electricity , paper , and textile etc . ) and fostering the new and high technology industries ( i . e . Software , new material , new energy , and digital industry etc . ) , announced in the 11 th five - year plan for socioeconomic development in Guangzhou Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector in Guangzhou . Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector were decomposed yearly first ( Table 6 ) and divided into 3 periods ( Fig 5 ) . Although the residential carbon emissions in Guangzhou accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total carbon emissions , it exhibited a rapid growth trend during the whole research period along with the improvement of urbanization level . The total residential carbon emissions increased from 0 . 55 million tons in 2003 accounting for 3 . 61 % of the total carbon emissions to 2 . 01 million tons accounting for 6 . 59 % in 2013 . Furthermore , the residential carbon emission increments were mainly generated by the urban residents , which increased from 0 . The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model was always two times of the average income of rural residents during the same period . The energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth , resulting in a 0 . 26 million tons decrease , accounting for 34 . 87 % of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value . During the 12 th five - year plan period ( 2010 - 2013 ) , Guangzhou ' s residential carbon emissions increased by 0 . 51 million tons . The affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) and the carbon intensity effect of urban ( f - effect - Urban ) were the most two dominant positive driving factors on the carbon emissions increment , bringing in 0 . 49 million tons and 0 . 29 million tons increase , accounting for 95 . 88 % and 57 . 43 % of the total residential carbon emissions changes , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 237}, "obj": "ne"}]}
