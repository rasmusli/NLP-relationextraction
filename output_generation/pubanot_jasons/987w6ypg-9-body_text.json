This dual mechanism of inhibition may be similarly exerted against other viruses . Figure 1 Expression of IFITMs in virus producing cells affects the production of infectious HIV - 1 viral particles . A ) Representation of the experimental scheme used here . HEK293T cells were trans transfected with DNAs coding for single round infection - competent HIV - 1 expressing GFP along with DNAs coding Flag - IFITMs . Virions were purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25 % sucrose cushion , normalized by exogenous - RT ( exo - RT ) and used to challenge HeLaP4 or HEK293T cells bearing the appropriate HIV - 1 receptors . Viral infectivity was measured 3 days later by flow cytometry in the case of GFP - coding viruses or 24 hours later by \u03b2 - gal assay in the case of a complete NL4 - 3 proviral DNA ( thanks to the HIV - 1 LTR - \u03b2 - gal reporter integrated in HeLaP4 cells ) . B ) Typical FACS profiles obtained after this procedure . C ) Normalized infectivity of viral particles obtained after flow cytometry analysis ( left graph ) or MAGI assay ( right graph ) . D ) As above , except that HIV - 1 viruses coding GFP were pseudotyped with the indicated envelope proteins . E ) As above , except that distinct retroviral vectors pseudotyped with VSVg and coding GFP were analyzed . F ) As above , except that HIV - 1 vectors bearing the indicated envelope were used to challenge the indicated target cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days after infection . DCs and MDM were obtained after differentiation of primary human blood monocytes in GM - CSF / IL4 or M - CSF for 4 to 6 days . PBLs were activated with PHA / IL2 for 24 hours prior to viral challenge . All graphs present averages and SEM obtained from 4 to 6 independent experiments . * indicates statistically significant differences between WT and IFITMs conditions after a Student t test : p \u2264 0 , 05 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
