The features of our experimental design and data analysis are as follows : 1 . The kinetic changes in the expression levels of cellular proteins along the infection course , consisting of five different time points , were quantified , which represented an improvement over a cross - sectional picture if only a sample from a single time point was analysed ; these results provided us a kinetic view of the changed expression of cellular proteins under the cytopathic insult of CPV infection . 2 . Two mocks were analysed . These two mocks helped to distinguish the natural kinetics of the cellular protein expression and helped to set reasonable standards to screen the DEPs . 3 . Three biological replicates were prepared for each sample to assess inter - experimental variations . 4 . The DEPs identified over the whole infection process were determined to be significant by an analysis of variance test , while those at each of the five time points were determined to be significant by the two - tailed unpaired t test .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
