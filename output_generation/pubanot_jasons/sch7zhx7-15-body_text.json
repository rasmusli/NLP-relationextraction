Approximately 30 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) of each mutant was diluted in a 2 . 5 mL inoculum of serum - free DMEM . The media on the Vero cells was aspirated and replaced with the 2 . 5 mL inoculum containing the virus . The inoculum was incubated on the cells for approximately 30 min at 37 \u2022 C . After 30 min , an overlay of 8 mL 0 . 8 % agarose was added to each dish . The dishes were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 2 days to allow plaque formation . The cells were fixed with 4 % formalin and the agarose plugs removed . The fixed cells were stained with crystal violet . Plaque size was determined using ImageJ software ( Version 1 . 51k ) [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 254}, "obj": "ne"}]}
