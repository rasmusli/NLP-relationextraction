Real - time RT - qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 hpi showed decreased CxVir1 expression in cells overexpressing CxCul4 compared with control ( empty vector ) cells in WNV infected cells . However , treatment of cells overexpressing CxCul4 with MG132 or PYR - 41 resulted in significantly higher levels of CxVir1 expression compared with untreated cells . Real - time RT - qPCR for WNV NS1 showed there was a decrease in viral replication in cells transfected with CxCul4 and treated with MG132 or PYR - 41 compared with the control ( CxCul4 transfection alone ) ( Fig 4D ) . To further determine significance of CxCul4 in STAT signaling , Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 . As a control , cells were either not transfected ( No dsRNA ) or transfected with dsRNA against GFP ( GFP dsRNA ) . Cells were infected with WNV 24 hours post - transfection and total RNA was collected 48 hpi . Real time RT - qPCR using CxVir1 primers showed increased expression after WNV infection which was further increased in cells transfected with CxCul4 dsRNA ( Fig 4E ) . CxVago on the other hand showed increased expression after WNV infection with no further increase in cells with CxCul4 dsRNA . To determine that action of CxCUl4 is via CxSTAT , cells were transfected with CxSTAT dsRNA along with dsRNA against CxCul4 . Cells were infected with WNV 24 hours post - transfection . Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real time RT - qPCR using WNV NS1 primers showed significant increase in cells with CxSTAT dsRNA and decrease in cells with CxCul4 dsRNA . Cells containing both CxCul4 and CxSTAT dsRNA showed no decrease in WNV NS1 levels indicating that CxCul4 action required CxSTAT ( Fig 4F ) . These results confirm that pro - viral effect of CxCul4 is via ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 226}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 253}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 293}, "obj": "ne"}]}
