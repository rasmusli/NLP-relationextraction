The separation of the layers allowed the identification of 3 / 10 non - laying birds , over a longer period of 4 weeks . On week 11 pi we euthanized and necropsied all of the birds and we observed egg yolk peritonitis in the three birds in which laying had stopped . Abunda yolk material filled the abdomen and the serosa appeared thickened and characterized by a strong yellow pigmentation . In these birds , the ovary had multiple follicles at different stages of maturation , indicating a normal function of the organ , and the oviduct appeared to be macroscopically normal . The histological examination of the oviducts highlighted that in the three birds with egg yolk peritonitis , the infundibulum architecture was altered by the extensive presence of fibrosis , cystic glands and dysplasia of the mucosa ; hyperplastic lymphocytic follicles and a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were also evident . The rest of the oviduct had no lesion ( Figure 5 ; Table 3 ) . We did not record any pathological aspect in the remaining animals , in which egg production had returned to normality .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
