After virus purification and normalization , viral particles were used to challenge HEK293T cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards . Under these conditions , viruses produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity that ranged from 90 % in the case of SIV MAC - VSVg to 40 % in the case of HIV - 1 - GALV or HIV - 1 - RD - TR . IFITM3 seemed to exert a lower effect on the infectivity of MLV - VSVg in comparison with IFITM1 and \u2212 2 , yet this defect was clearly detectable and statistically significant . Overall , these results indicate that the expression of IFITMs during the phase of viral particles production impairs the infectivity of the retroviruses tested here .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
