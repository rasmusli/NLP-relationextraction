Subsequently , qPCR was performed to determine FPV viral loads in DNA extracts of mesenteric lymph nodes and tissues from these cases using a TaqMan qPCR assay as described previously [ 14 ] . Faecal samples containing vaccine virus were also submitted to a commercial laboratory for batch testing on a multiplex qPCR panel to detect potential faecal co - pathogens including Feline coronavirus , Tritrichom foetus , Clostridium perfringens , Giardia spp , Salmonella spp , Campylobacter jejuni , Campylobacter coli and Toxoplasma gondii ( Idexx Pty Ltd . ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
