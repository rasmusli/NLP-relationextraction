{"cord_uid": "u14tj0so", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4064103", "divid": "57", "text": "As mentioned in Section ' Background ' , in the literature on hierarchical folding , there are reports of counter examples to the hierarchical folding hypothesis where bases that are initially part of the pseudoknot - free structure for a molecule later change as the pseudoknot forms . This motivates a comparison of HFold versus Iterative HFold , in order to see how a method that sticks strictly with the hypothesis ( i . e . , HFold ) compares with a method that allows for some base changes ( i . e . , Iterative HFold ) . In Section ' Rob comparison ' , we compare the robustness of HFold and Iterative HFold with respect to partial information ; that is , the degree to which they provide accurate predictions as a function of how much http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 information about G big , the true pseudoknot - free secondary structure , is provided as input . Then in Section ' Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold ' we compare HFold , HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold when a ( possibly inaccurate ) computational prediction of G big is provided as input . In Section ' Accuracy comparison with existing methods ' we compare Iterative HFold - the method that performs best overall in Sections ' Robustness comparison ' and ' Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold ' with existing methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction . Sections ' Running time comparison ' and ' Memory consumption comparison ' report on the running time and memory usage of our methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
