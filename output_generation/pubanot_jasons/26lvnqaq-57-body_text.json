In one of these two animals , focal ulcerations of the mucosa were also described . On day 6 pi , in 3 / 7 birds , severe diffuse necrosis involving the full width of the tonaca mucosa , associated with edema and a granulomatous process were recorded at the level of the infundibulum ( Figure 5 ) , and in one of these subjects the lesions extended to the magnum and isthmus . In the other two subjects , the magnum , isthmus and uterus appeared normal . Ten days from challenge , 1 / 7 of the birds showed diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the lamina propria , mild fibrosis and multifocal ectasia of the glands ; in 4 / 7 of the birds a mild heterophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the mucosa of the infundibulum was observed , and in two of these birds , a similar picture was observed at the level of the magnum , while the isthmus and uterus appeared normal . On day 18 pi , 3 / 7 of the birds had a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the mucosa of the infundibulum , with follicular organization , diffuse ectasia of the glands and interstitial fibrosis of the lamina propria . The histopathology score assigned to the infundibulum , magnum and uterus indicates the infundibulum as the most affected section of the oviduct from 4 to 10 days pi ( Table 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
