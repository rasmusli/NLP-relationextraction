The frequency of pathogen positive specimens and incidence of coinfections were significantly higher in under - one children , which makes it the most vulnerable age group for ARIs . Additionally , around 87 % ( 54 / 62 ) of the RSV cases were detected in children less than one year of age . The frequency of RSV infections in this age group seems to be a consequence of multifactorial complex events , involving especially immunological factors . Mat antibodies are a vital means of protection to infants against respiratory viruses as they have a relatively immature immune system to mount an effective immune response . RSV antibodies are found in all adults and children older than three years of age . At one year of age , 25 - 50 % of children have antibodies against RSV , indicating the high frequency of this infection at a young age [ 52 ] and then the incidence of RSV infections decreases with age , probably because of the development of anti - RSV immunity which is boosted during each subsequent re - infection [ 53 ] . Currently , there are no effective antivirals or vaccines against RSV infections . Several RSV vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials and have yet to be licensed [ 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
