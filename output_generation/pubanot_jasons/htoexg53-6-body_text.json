This new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure [ 1 ] . To date , the MERS - CoV still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities [ 2 , 3 ] . Epidemiological data suggest that the MERS - CoV is endemic in Saudi Arabia , which accounts for the majority of primary community - acquired cases . Many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with dromedary camels , the primary animal reservoir of MERS - CoV . Alternatively , camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals [ 4 , 5 ] . Other outbreaks of MERS have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Most of the MERS - CoV infections occur within the Arabian Peninsula , i . e . , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and United Arab Emirates , however MERS cases have been reported in various other countries around the world [ 9 , 10 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
