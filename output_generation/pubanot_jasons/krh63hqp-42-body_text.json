Given that the modern strains of H1N1 have diverged from the original 1918 strain by nearly 2000 mutations , that many of these mutations should be slightly deleterious [ 67 ] , and that natural selection was unable to stop their continuous accumulation in the first place , it is difficult to imagine how mutation / selection might ever restore full virulence . Reassortment might bring in new material , but thus far this has only applied to a limited section of the genome , and reassortment today occurs in a very different mutational / genomic context than that of 95 years ago . It is often thought that a high mutation rate translates to rapid adaptation and evolution , yet the reverse seems more commonly true . Deleterious mutations often interfere with selection for the more rare beneficial mutations [ 67 , 68 ] . Thus , the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual extinction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
