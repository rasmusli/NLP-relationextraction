In our study , skin injuries were reported in 33 / 101 ( 33 % ) of S . suis patients compared to 18 / 303 ( 6 % ) of hospital controls and 11 / 300 ( 4 % ) of community controls ( Table 3 ) . These minor skin injuries may allow direct entry of the bacteria in people with direct contact with infected pigs or pork . Contact with pigs within the last two weeks in the presence of skin lesions was associated with a significant high risk of infection ( Table 6 ) . Skin injuries were most often recorded in slaughter house workers , cooks and housewives involved in processing meat . Skin protection , including gloves , hand washing and exclusion of people with obvious skin lesions from direct contact with pigs and pork meat , may help to reduce the incidence of the disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
