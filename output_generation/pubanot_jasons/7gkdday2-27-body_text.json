As we can see in Table 4 , HRV was observed as the most predominant coinfection partner , showing its presence with almost all of the pathogens . The major coinfection viral partners of HRV included RSV ( six ) , HPIV - 3 ( five ) HMPV ( four ) , adenovirus ( four ) , HB ( three ) , and Inf A ( one ) viruses . In addition , HRV was co - detected in 9 out of 10 K . pneumoniae infection cases , whereas it was co - detected in only five S . pneumoniae cases . After HRV , RSV was the second most predominant pathogen and it was co - detected mainly with S . pneumoniae , K . pneumoniae , Streptococcus species , E . agglomerans , and H . influenzae and a total of 20 bacterial isolates had been found with RSV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
