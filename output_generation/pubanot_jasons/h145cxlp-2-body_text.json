B ) and between patients infected with different influenza A subtypes showed only small differences when controlling for age [ 9 , 10 ] . During the pandemic , however , some studies observed increased morbidity and mortality among children compared to previous seasonal influenza [ 6 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] , while other studies described the clinical features of A ( H1N1 ) pdm0 as being similar or even milder [ 14 , 15 ] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and fatal viral pneumonia was observed more frequently during the pandemic [ 16 ] . Post - pandemic surveillance was recommended , as circulation of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 was expected to continue for several years , gradually assuming a seasonal influenza pattern [ 16 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
