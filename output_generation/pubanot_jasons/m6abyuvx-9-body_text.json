Each rVV encoded a different HCV protein ; rVV - CN2 encoded mainly structural proteins , rVV - N25 encoded nonstructural proteins , and rVV - CN5 encoded the entire HCV protein region ( Figure 2A ) . Because rVVs can express a variety of proteins and induce strong and long - term immunity , they have been evaluated as potential prophylactic vaccines [ 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
