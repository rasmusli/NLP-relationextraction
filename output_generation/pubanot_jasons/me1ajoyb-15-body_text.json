In experimental infections of rats with SEOV and deer mice with SNV , early infection results in subtle inflammatory signatures , but a regulatory T cell ( Treg ) response predominates at persistence ( Figure 1 ) [ 20 , 54 ] . Treg responses are critical for suppressing inflammation [ 71 , 72 ] ; however , inflammation is a prominent feature of hantavirus disease in humans [ 73 ] and hamsters [ 55 , 74 ] . In other viral diseases , the occurrence of a Treg response is associated with persistent infection because these cells , while suppressing inflammation , also prevent virus clearance [ 75 , 76 ] . For reservoirs of hantaviruses , the Treg response may limit inflammatory immunopathology to an otherwise innocuous infection , but it may also impair virus clearance . How this relationship evolved is unknown , but considering the presence of hantavirus proteins with immunomodulatory activities , it suggests the viruses may manipulate the host response to favor persistence ; a Treg response may prevent sterilizing immunity , thus allow virus to remain in a population . It may also explain the ecoimmunology and ecology of hantavirus infections of reservoir hosts , thus studies assessing the energetics of inflammatory and anti - inflammatory immune responses should be performed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
