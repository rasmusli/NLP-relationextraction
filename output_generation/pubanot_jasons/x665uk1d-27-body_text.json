Figure 7B shows that the viability of WT mice challenged with PRV was 11 % ( 2 / 18 ) . The viabilities of the STG69 and STG135 lines against PRV challenges were about 40 % ( 8 / 20 ) and 17 % ( 4 / 24 ) , respectively . However , the STG90 line showed 53 % ( 9 / 17 ) viability . These data were described by Kaplan - Meier analysis .
