Our demonstration of abundant FcRn on human penile urethral epithelium supports a model where exposure to antibodybound HIV - 1 might lead to enhanced female - to - male transmission . It should be noted that the pH of vaginal secretions is typically about 4 , which is below the pH required for Fc - FcRn binding [ 48 ] . However , there is substantial variability in normal vaginal pH [ 26 , 48 ] , and we did begin to observe enhanced transcytosis at pH 4 . 5 ( Figure S3H ) . Furthermore , it is possible that there is some buffering effect of foreskin and urethral secretions . The foreskin , whose presence increases HIV infection rate , could trap secretions containing HIV - 1 immune complexes and thereby allow greater urethral exposure to infected material within the pH range of Fc - FcRn binding [ 49 ] . Additionally , bacterial vaginosis , a condition associated with an increased risk of female - to - male ( as well as male - female ) HIV transmission , results in vaginal secretions ideal for Fc - FcRn binding [ 26 , 27 , 50 ] . Exposure of penile tissues to the pH range of Fc - FcRn binding may also occur after ejaculation , since complete neutralization of vaginal acidity may not occur immediately or at all [ 29 ] . It is also possible , though less likely , that FcRn mediates HIV transmission via the penis during insertive anal intercourse , where the penis may come into contact with slightly acidic rectal secretions [ 30 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
