Sexually transmitted infections , other causes of inflammation , and localized trauma may allow susceptible CD4 + target cells at skin or mucosal surfaces to become directly exposed to secretions from infected sexual partners [ 1 , 2 ] . However , when skin and mucosa are intact , it remains unclear precisely how HIV - 1 gains access to target cells . One possibility is that virus translocates between epithelial cells until susceptible cells are found either in or below the epithelium [ 3 ] . Alternatively , Langerhans cells may sample the surface , acquire virus , and move it to areas of abundant target cells [ 4 , 5 ] . Finally , transcytosis of HIV - 1 ( i . e . , movement through cells ) has been studied as a potential mechanism to translocate virus from mucosal surfaces to deeperlying CD4 + cells [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
