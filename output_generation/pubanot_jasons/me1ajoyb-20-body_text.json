Pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit antiviral responses despite high levels of replication , whereas nonpathogenic viruses are efficiently recognized and elicit innate responses that limit replication [ 83 , 84 ] . This antagonistic capacity must have evolved in the reservoir hosts of these hantaviruses because humans are dead - end hosts . To date , few studies have addressed the interactions between hantaviruses and their rodent hosts in vitro . This is partially due to the unavailability of cell lines , and the reagents and techniques to generate primary cell cultures from the various reservoirs of hantaviruses . The Norway rat / SEOV system is the most tractable for studying virus / reservoir interactions . Inoculation of rat lung - derived endothelial cells with SEOV resulted in virus replication , but little or no induction of cytokines or chemokines , suggesting SEOV can efficiently antagonize antiviral responses [ 21 ] . Despite this , endothelial cells increased their expression of the protein PD - L1 , which correlated with the ability of these cells to induce Treg cell activity . In addition , antigen presenting cells isolated from Norway rats and infected with SEOV in vitro were resistant to stimulation , suggesting that virus infection inhibits the normal signaling activities of these cells [ 85 ] . Thus antagonism of the innate immune response likely allows for viral replication , while at the same time promotes an anti - inflammatory response that limits immunopathology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
