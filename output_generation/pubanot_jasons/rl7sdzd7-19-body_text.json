A . Sensitivity of LAMP using genomic target . DNA from MS8 / RF3 sample ( 16 ng . \u03bcL - 1 ) was serially diluted and amplified by LAMP , in triplicate , using primers to assay for the RF3 junction . The numbers in parenthesis represent the approximate copy numbers of the target assuming that the sample represents RF3 in a hemizygous state ( determined using RT - PCR data not shown ) for the transgene and using 1 pg as the genome size for oilseed rape . C is the no DNA control and M represents molecular size markers . The smear ( * ) shows an example of non - specific amplification . B . Sensitivity of LAMP using plasmid target . Serial dilutions of the plasmid pGreenII were amplified using primers for the Pnos target . Numbers represent the calculated copy numbers of the plasmid derived from the DNA value . C is the no DNA control and M represents molecular sized markers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
