An estimated 226 , 160 new cases of lung cancer was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone , and 160 , 340 lung cancer deaths are estimated to occur [ 1 ] . Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer . Protein levels of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , a mediator of inflammation , were reported elevated in several cancer types , including colorectal , prostate , and lung cancers , and suppression of either COX - 2 expression or COX - 2 activation , is being considered for cancer prevention and therapy [ 2 ] . Of the five prostaglandins ( PG ) produced by COX - 2 , PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in tumor cell proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis , and immunosuppression [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1 - 4 . These receptors have also been implicated in tumor cell growth and progression [ 6 , 7 ] . PGE 2 is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also showing a higher incidence of lung cancer [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
