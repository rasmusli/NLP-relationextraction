Although these viruses cannot productively infect purified PBMCs in vitro , they share the ability to induce cytopathic effects ( CPE ) in CrFK and fcwf - 4 cells . These feline cell lines , however , do not alter their mRNA levels of genes selected as markers for innate immunity upon direct treatment with ODN 2216 ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown ) , preventing from assessing the potential of this molecule to inhibit viral replication directly in these cells . Thus , CrFK and fcwf - 4 cells were incubated , prior to their inoculation , with the cell - free supernatants of PBMCs mentioned above : Sup 2216 , Sup 2243 and Sup Neg . To this aim , supernatants derived from PBMCs treated for 24 h were selected , as Sup 2216 produced by the cells of several adult cats were estimated to contain optimal type I IFN amounts at this time point , according to the induction of Mx transcription measured directly in these immune cells ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . CrFK and fcwf - 4 target cells were then incubated with the supernatants for 24 h before inoculation , as this time span had indicated highest induction of antiviral mechanisms ( Figure 4F ) . The antiviral effects of the supernatants were initially tested on vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) as control , as this virus is widely recognized for both its potential to induce CPE in cell lines of multiple species and for its particularly high sensitivity to the effects of type I IFN [ 65 , 66 ] . When the Sup 2216 derived from the PBMCs of eight adult cats that had broadly responded to in vitro ODN 2216 stimulation ( Figure 2B and C , groups 2 and 3 ) were incubated with fcwf - 4 cells prior to their inoculation , significant inhibition of VSV replication was observed ( p = 0 . 0039 ) ( Figure 5A ) . The replication of this virus was also to some degree repressed by Sup 2243 ( p = 0 . 0078 ) , an observation Table 1 ) . Both Sup 2243 and Sup Neg failed to inhibit replication of this heterogeneous group of feline viruses , underlining the essential role of the 2216 molecule in conferring the observed effects . Importantly , cells stimulated with ODN 2216 directly did not indicate any resistance to viral replication , in concordance to their impaired response to this molecule already measured on a genetic level ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown ) . With respect to the younger cats , the Sup 2216 of those 2 kittens whose cells responded to ODN 2216 stimulation ( Figure 2A , group 1 ) could also inhibit both VSV and FCV on fcwf - 4 cells , while the supernatants derived from the PBMCs of the other 2 kittens indicated no inhibition potential on these viruses ( Figure 5K and L ) . Altogether , the viral suppression potential of Sup 2216 from all the cats could be compared to that conferred by treatment of the cells with 10 to 100U rfeIFN\u03b1 , a quantity determined in titration experiments of rfeIFN\u03b1 conducted together with the viral inhibition assays ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
