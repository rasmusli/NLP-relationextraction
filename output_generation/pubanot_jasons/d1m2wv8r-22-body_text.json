As shown in Fig . 4b , many proteins related to cell apoptosis were enriched in cluster A , and they were up - regulated during the entire infection period , but most strikingly at 48 and 60 hpi . Thus , we concluded that the late stage of CPV infection was a better time to investigate the CPV - induced F81 cell apoptosis process . As apoptosis may be the main mechanism utilised by viral oncolytic therapy , these identified DEPs may be useful for detailed studies in the future .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
