A - I All pictures were taken using a 10 \u00d7 objective from 4 - \u03bcm sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin . B During the acute phase of infection ( 4 - 10 days pi ) , replication of the virus in the infundibulum was associated with the occurrence of severe necrosis , edema and granulomatous processes in the mucosa of the organ . C In the chronic phase of the disease ( 70 - 80 days pi ) , birds with egg yolk peritonitis showed a profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture due to the presence of ectatic glands ( asterisk ) , hyperplastic lymphocytic aggregates ( arrows ) and thinning of the mucosa . E , H Lesions in the magnum and uterus were rarely observed during the acute phase of the infection and were limited to heterophilic necrosis and edema ( arrow heads ) , respectively . F , I A full restoration of the tissue integrity was observed for the magnum and uterus in all subjects , after 70 - 80 days from infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
