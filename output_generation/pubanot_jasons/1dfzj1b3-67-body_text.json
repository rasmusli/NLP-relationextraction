The presence of reducing agents causes the conversion of Fe 3 + / ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form that may be followed at 700 nm due to the formation of Perl ' s Prussian blue Fe 4 [ Fe ( CN ) 6 ] 3 . Increasing absorbance at 700 nm indicates an increase in reductive ability [ 44 ] . Several authors along with other antioxidant activity assays also tested the reducing power of the essential oils of Himalayan Lauraceae species [ 44 ] , Myrtus communis var . italica [ 46 ] , Hymenocrater longiflorus [ 47 ] , Origanum onites L . [ 82 ] and Psammogeton canescens [ 49 ] . In this case , the antioxidant activity measured by the \u03b2 - carotene bleaching and DPPH tests showed weak activity . The authors attributed such activity to the low concentration of phenolic compounds present in the essential oils , nevertheless the reducing power of the same samples is similar to that of the reference ascorbic acid , mainly at higher concentrations [ 49 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 79}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 89}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 296}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 424}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 428, "end": 431}, "obj": "ne"}]}
