QSR NVivo 11 software was used to organize and share the data among study team members . We used an interpretive approach which focuses on the participants ' perceptions and interpretations of the topic of discussion . Thematic analysis was used to inductively identify themes from the data . We drew on techniques from the constant comparative method , such as line by line analysis , naming each line and segment of data , and the use of subsequent interviews to test preliminary assumptions . In addition , deviant cases were explored and examined [ 20 , 21 ] . The conduct of the interviews and coding occurred concurrently to enable the researchers to determine when theme saturation had been reached and to cease recruitment . Thematic saturation was established when the research team discussed and agreed that no new themes were emerging from the data . To improve the credibility of our findings , we conducted a member check at the final stage of manuscript preparation to validate our interpretation of the data and to ensure an accurate representation of participant perspectives . We were unable to contact a few of the participants as they have moved on to another role and their contact information was not readily available .
