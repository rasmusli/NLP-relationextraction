{"cord_uid": "p95vzcoy", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6920936", "divid": "5", "text": "Since virus - infected brood and adults are often expelled from honeybee colonies [ 33 - 36 ] and ants are often seen foraging such bees in apiaries ( personal observations ) , it appears as if ants are very likely to consume DWV - infected food . However , there are only few studies on virus transmission between honeybees and ants . DWV and Kashmir Bee Virus ( KBV ) presence plus replication was detected in invasive argentine ants ( Linepithema humile ) as well as presence of Black queen cell virus ( BQCV ) in Linepithema hum and Anoplolepis gracilipes [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] . Further , DWV and other honeybee viruses ( BQCV , Israeli acute paralysis virus and Sacbrood virus ) were detected in Camponotus sp . ants [ 19 ] . Similarly , chronic bee paralysis virus seems to be able to replicate in ants Camponotus vagus [ 29 ] . So far , no study has yet experimentally addressed the efficacy of foodborne virus transmission between honeybees and predators / scavengers . Since ants are ubiquitous and play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] , virus transmission from managed honeybees might pose a considerable threat , given the virus is able to exploit the novel hosts . On the other hand , viruses and other pathogens may help limiting the spread of invasive M . rubra populations [ 37 , 44 ] . Novel hosts can be biological vectors that support virus replication or reservoirs and mechanical vectors without virus replication [ 4 ] . Further , spillover events can also be bidirectional , from the novel host back to the initial host [ 1 ] , possibly resulting in altered virulence and respective consequences as e . g . , for influenza [ 45 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 230}, "obj": "ne"}]}
