{"cord_uid": "opjd4ylh", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6949926", "divid": "6", "text": "In the Limpopo Province of South Africa , TB is ranked the fourth among the major causes of death [ 5 ] . In 2009 , the Limpopo Provincial TB Annual Report [ 6 ] stated that the number of TB cases in Vhembe district was 2194 . In 2012 , Vhembe district had the highest number of TB patients in the Limpopo Province [ 7 ] . Tshitangano et al . [ 8 ] , further indicated that TB infection control plans were not available at hospitals in Vhembe district and this contributed to the high number of TB patients . Infect control requires both human and material resources for maintenance and support [ 8 ] . In line with this assertion , Gursimrat [ 9 ] argues that one of the major challenges to control TB infection includes poor primary healthcare infrastructure . In addition , shortage of space and beds in the wards hinder separation of Multi - Drug Resistant TB ( MDR - TB ) and TB patients in healthcare facilities and these increases risk of contracting infection in the wards [ 10 ] . Healthcare - associated TB has become a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers . It was therefore imperative to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for tuberculosis patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe district , Limpopo Province .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
