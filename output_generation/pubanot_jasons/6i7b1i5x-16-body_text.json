On binding bronchial epithelium specimens from children with KD , antibodies J and A identified intracellular inclusions ( ICI ) [ 51 , 57 ] . In a subsequent study , 26 % of the control group , composed primarily of adult patients , had similar inclusion bodies that were bound by antibody J [ 105 ] . Although many viruses can reactivate during stress ( Her family ) or are considered ' slow ' viral infections [ 106 ] , the failure of numerous attempts to identify a specific infectious agent argues against such a persistent infection [ 57 ] . There remains the possibility that this is a difficult to culture virus , such as coronavirus , which had also enjoyed a short - lived consideration as the cause of KD [ 107 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
