Much like its counterparts in other systems , Ubp9 is only catalytically active when bound to two WDR proteins , Bun107 , which is homologous to WDR48 , and Bun62 , which is homologous to WDR20 . Interestingly , Ubp9 stability and subcellular localization can be regulated by interaction with the WDR proteins . Kouranti et al . ( 2010 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
