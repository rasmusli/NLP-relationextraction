CVB3 plasmids containing either the 2A mutant protease or 3C mutant protease were used to clone the mutant proteases . To target the 2A and 2A mutant proteases , the primers included SacI and XbaI recognition sites ( Table 1 ) . Primers against the 3C and 3C mutant proteases included NotI and XbaI recognition sites . Protease sequences were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pFLAG - CMV - LAP1 vector . Clones were verified for sequencing ( GenScript , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . Oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequence for the wild - type and mutant 2A and 3C protease targets were designed and cloned into the pGlo - 3F vector and verified by sequencing ( GenScript ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
