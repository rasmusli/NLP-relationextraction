CPIJ010574 is orthologous to mammalian Cullin4A and Cullin 4B ( ~ 70 % amino acid identity with both ) ( S3 Fig ) and is therefore referred to here as CxCul4 . Cullin - RING ligases , such as Cullin4A , have been found to be upregulated during WNV infection of mammalian cells and implicated in various cellular processes such cell cycle regulation , signal transduction , DNA replication as well as viral replication [ 33 ] . Initially , in vivo validation of RNA - Seq analysis was performed using a mosquito infection model . Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were infected with WNV ( NY99 - 4132 strain ) by blood - feeding . Total RNA was collected from whole carcasses and dissected midguts at 24 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR performed using CxCul4 - specific primers showed approximately 4 - and 12 - fold increases in mRNA in carcass and midgut , respectively , compared with control mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood ( Fig 3A ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 95}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 267}, "obj": "ne"}]}
