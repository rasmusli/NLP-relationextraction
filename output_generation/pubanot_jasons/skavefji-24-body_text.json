However , the proposed cutoff values of sTREM - 1 concentration vary widely ( 5 - 900 pg / ml ) and some studies have questioned the reliability of BAL fluid sTREM - 1 [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] . Studies on BAL fluid sTREM - 1 have mainly been confined to patients with ventilator - associated pneumonia . Therefore , the usefulness of sTREM - 1 for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia , especially differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia , has not been elucidated yet . The current study directly compared patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia , and therefore differs from previous studies of sTREM - 1 . BAL fluid sTREM - 1 concentration in combination with the BAL fluid cellular profile might exhibit better diagnostic performance , although this warrants further studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
