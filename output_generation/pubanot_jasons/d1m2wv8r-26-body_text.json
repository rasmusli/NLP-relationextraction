Some of these proteins were not noted for CPV - induced apoptosis or anti - cancer function , which would provide a new perspective for studying the anti - cancer mechanisms of CPV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 41}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 361}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 496}, "obj": "ne"}]}
