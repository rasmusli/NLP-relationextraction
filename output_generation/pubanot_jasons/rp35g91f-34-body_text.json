At the transcript level , the expression of all factors except Nkx2 - 5 could be detected in the lung ( lung , adult : CNhs10474 ctss ) . The absence of Nkx2 - 5 expression in adult lung is an apparent paradox since this factor has previously been shown to be required for pulmonary myocardium identity ( Millino et al . 2000 ; Mommersteeg et al . 2007 ) . However , whether the lung sections sampled in the Fantom5 project actually contain pulmonary myocardium cannot be determined . In contrast , Nkx2 - 5 low - level expression in the BXD lung data set could be detected with a mean of 7 . 798 log 2 units [ background is generally considered to be , 7 log 2 units ( Geisert et al . 2009 ) ] . Further , Nkx2 - 5 expression in the lung data set was significantly positively correlated with almost all the members of the pulmonary myocardium gene network ( Table 4 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
