The continuous and linear accumulation of mutations within a single influenza lineage , as was seen in H1N1 during the 2009 - 2010 influenza season ( in which about 0 . 3 % of all nucleotides mutated ) , supports the concept that natural genetic attenuation may be an important factor in the natural cessation of influenza pandemics . Thus , the possibility of an artificial acceleration of mutation rate deserves further investigation , and may suggest new avenues of research in terms of pandemic management [ 13 ] . It is clear that natural selection is strongly at work in the influenza genome . This can be seen by preservation of all the basic proteins and functions of the virus , in spite of the fact that every possible point mutation happens in every human individual during the course of an infection . A large fraction of all deleterious mutations clearly must be selected away . Likewise , the emergence of major antigenic variants shows that positive selection is operational . It is also clear that genetic drift is strongly in operation , with a major viral bottleneck happening at each transmission from one human host to the next , and perhaps at the start of each local outbreak [ 33 ] , ensuring that most unique genotypes are very quickly lost . Yet , in addition to selection and drift , it also appears there is very strong mutational pressure on the influenza genome , potentially leading to lethal mutagenesis in most strains , and a gradual , natural genetic attenuation of human influenza in general .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
