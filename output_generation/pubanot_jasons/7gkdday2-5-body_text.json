So , detection of the potential causative agents is the prerequisite for proper treatment and viral detection can reduce the irrational and overuse of antibiotics . ARIs due to bacterial infections have become a global concern especially because of the emergence of an increasing number of multi - drug resistant bacteria . Although some studies have examined the viral etiology of ARIs in the under - five children in Bangladesh , information is lacking on bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance / sensitivity pattern [ 10 , 11 ] . Lack of information regarding etiological agents influences the use of inappropriate and broad spectrum antibiotics which in turn fosters antimicrobial resistance . The purpose of this study was to examine both viral and bacterial pathogens of ARIs among under - five children of Bangladesh in hospital settings over a period of 1 year . The viral pathogens were identified using RT - qPCR targeting 10 common respiratory viruses and microbiological culture method was used to examine pathogenic bacterial spectrum and determine their antibiotic susceptibility pattern .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
