Howie et al . recently investigated pneumonia etiology in children in Gambia , observing that S . pneumoniae was the leading cause with a high rate of microbial agent co - detection [ 15 ] . Conversely , they found that viral pneumonia was not predominant whereas we observed that 3 viruses , namely human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus , were associated with pneumonia in Mali . Major differences between the 2 studies were sample type ( lung aspirates vs . nasal swabs in our investigation ) and the lack of a comparative group in the study by Howie et al . which did not permit comparison of microbial prevalence in pneumonia patients and healthy subjects [ 15 ] . In a Western Kenya case - control study , S . pneumoniae , RSV , and influenza A virus were the predominant causes of pneumonia in children [ 16 ] . We noted almost similar results in Mali . Thus , S . pneumoniae and RSV could still be considered as the primary causes of pneumonia in several sub - Sharan African countries . All patients who died had severe pneumonia , according to WHO criteria , with significant dyspnea , very marked chest indrawing and severe hypoxia . Two patients had confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia . Two patients had acute malnutrition linked with pneumonia . In 2 cases , death occurred within 24 hours of admission . Despite active treatment with antibiotics and oxygen , the management of severe respiratory distress is often difficult in this context because the hospital does not have assisted ventilatory support . Mortality was higher than in a recent birth cohort in South Africa [ 17 ] , but was similar to what was reported previously in other developing countries [ 18 , 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
