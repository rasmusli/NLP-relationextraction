All raw data files generated by mass spectrometry were analysed by Proteome Discoverer software 1 . 3 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) using the Mascot search engine against the Felis catus protein sequences downloaded from the NCBI reference sequences ( Refseq ) database ( downloaded on March 20 , 2015 , containing 35 , 247 entries ) . The parameters for database searching were as follows : trypsin was selected as the enzyme ; up to two missed cleavages were allowed ; the precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance were set to 15 pp and 20 mmu , respectively ; carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification ; oxidation on methionine and iTRAQ 8 plex labels at the N - termini and at lysine side chains were allowed as dynamic modifications . The strict maximum parsimony principle was applied , and only peptide spectrum matches with high or medium confidence were considered for protein grouping . Ion peaks were integrated based on the most confident centroid with a tolerance of 20 ppm .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
