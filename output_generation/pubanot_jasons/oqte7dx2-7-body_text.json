A recent study using cultured rodent neurons showed that USP46 regulation of AMPARs is conserved in mammals . Mammalian USP46 can deubiquitinate both GluA1 and GluA2 subunits and protect AMPARs from degradation ( Huo et al . , 2015 ) . USP46 is expressed throughout the brain , including the hippocampus , amygdala , cerebellum and prefrontal cortex , and colocalizes with GluA1 and PSD95 at synapses in cultured neurons ( Tomida et al . , 2009 ; Huo et al . , 2015 ) . Knock - down of USP46 , but not USP12 , results in increased levels of ubiquitinated GluA1 , decreased surface and total levels of GluA1 , and reduced mEPSC amplitudes , consistent with a role for USP46 in deubiquitinating mammalian AMPARs ( Huo et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , GluA1 is preferentially modified with Lys63 - linked polyubiquitin chains , which typically promotes endo - lysosomal trafficking ( Huo et al . , 2015 ; Widagdo et al . , 2015 ) . Prior studies showed that USP enzymes have promiscuous chain selectivity and recombinant USP46 prefers Lys6 - and Lys11linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro ( Faesen et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , Huo et al . ( 2015 ) showed that USP46 preferentially deubiquitinates AMPARs with Lys63 - but not Lys48 - linked chains in HEK293 cells , suggesting that USP46 chain specificity is controlled by other factors in vivo . Together , these data reveal a conserved mechanism where USP46 deubiquitinates AMPARs at synapses to protect them from degradation and promote their recycling to the cell surface to affect synapse function . In addition to USP46 , USP8 can also deubiquitinate mammalian AMPARs indicating that multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control AMPAR ubiquitination levels ( Scudder et al . , 2014 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
