In addition to a multitude of homeostatic functions throughout development and healthy aging [ 10 , 11 ] , microglia participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses through recognition of pathogen - associated molecular patterns and damage - associated molecular patterns [ 12 ] , which stimulate morphological changes [ 13 , 14 ] and increase production of reactive oxidative species [ 15 , 16 ] and cytokines / chemokines [ 17 , 18 ] . During neurotropic virus infection , virally infected cells secrete chemokines including CCL2 , CCL5 , and CXCL10 , which facilitate immune cells crossing the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS is a hallmark of WNV encephalitis , and monocytes and T cells are critical for CNS virologic control . Elimination of monocytes using a liposome - encapsulated drug dichloromethylene diphosphonate or by genetic deletion of CCR2 increases mortality in mice infected with a neurotropic strain of WNV [ 22 , 23 ] . However , monocytes may also contribute to dissemination of virus to the CNS [ 24 , 25 ] , and inhibition of monocyte infiltration may also protect against nitric oxide - mediated immunopathology [ 26 ] . CD4 + T cells produce antiviral molecules , such as interferon \u03b3 ( IFN\u03b3 ) and IL - 2 , which promotes antiviral humoral immunity and sustains WNV - specific CD8 + T cell responses , enabling viral clearance in all organs [ 27 , 28 ] . CD8 + T cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from WNV infection via both cytopathic and noncytopathic mechanisms [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] . Mice lacking either CD8 + T cells or MHC - I molecules have higher CNS viral burdens , increased mortality after infection , and prolonged viral persistence , suggesting that cell - mediated immunity controls virus within the CNS [ 32 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
