Viral load in a specimen depends on several conditions , such as time of collection in relation to onset of illness . In most of the study children , the NPA specimen was collected early in the course of illness , which increases the likelihood of detecting an infectious agent [ 14 ] . Moreover , by not including children who had taken antibiotics during the last 48 hours , we primarily recruited new cases of pneumonia . Using multiplex instead of single molecular assays may have contributed to an underestimation of the number of viral CAP cases , as some loss of sensitivity is an inherent limitation of multiplex PCR assays [ 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
