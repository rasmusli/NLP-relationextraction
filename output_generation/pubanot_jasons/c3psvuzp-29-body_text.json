The PARP12 gene is in a poorly assembled region of the orangutan genome and was therefore incomplete . The PA gene is almost entirely deleted from the white - cheeked gibbon genome ; exon 4 is still present but contains a stop codon . We therefore used PARP12 and PARP15 sequences from the publically available gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla ) genome assembly to ensure that seven primate sequences were used in all analyses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
