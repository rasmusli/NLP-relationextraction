Arm swabs gave the highest RQ ( ratio of target ( SQPV ) to control gene ( PGK ) ) ( mean RQ = 0 . 18 \u00b1 0 . 14 CI , n = 12 ) and the greatest proportion of positive results in infected grey squirrels ( 0 . 83 ( 10 / 12 ) , 0 . 51 - 0 . 97 CI ) . Eyelid swabs also showed a relatively high RQ of SQPV DNA ( mean RQ = 0 . 029 \u00b1 0 . 027 CI , n = 12 ) , although it appears the area is less frequently infected , with the proportion of positive results from eyelid swabs being lower ( 0 . 58 ( 7 / 12 ) , 0 . 29 - 0 . 84 CI ) than on the arm . Flank skin samples appeared to be commonly infected with the virus in infected individuals ( 0 . 75 ( 9 / 12 ) , 0 . 43 - 0 . 93 CI ) but with a low intensity of infection ( RQ mean = 0 . 004 \u00b1 0 . 007 CI , n = 12 ) . Non - cutaneous samples showed low incidence and intensity of SQPV infection , with blood , stomach and skeletal muscle showing the highest prevalence of the virus in positive animals all ca . 0 . 3 ( Fig . 2b ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
