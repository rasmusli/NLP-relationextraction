In each of the three years , we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of pneumonia at the end of the monsoon season in August to September . There were also significant CAP epidemics during winter , the first year peaking in February and the second year in December , but we observed no winter epidemic in the third year . There were also smaller peaks of CAP in spring . Epidemics of infection with individual respiratory viruses contributed to literally all of these CAP epidemics , such as the three RS epidemics ( the second of which was compounded by epidemics with InfA and InfB infections ) , an InfA epidemic superimposed on an hMPV epidemic , and a PIV3 epidemic ( Figure 3 ) . Displays of the spatial - temporal distribution of these individual epidemics are visualized in [ 24 ] . PIV1 infections occurred in small numbers throughout the year , whereas only 17 cases of PIV2 infection were seen during the entire study period .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
