The standard stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of lycorine in 10 mL of methanol to produce a concentration of 100 g / mL . Series of working solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solution with methanol to give concentrations of 0 . 20 , The Scientific World Journal 3 0 . 78 , 3 . 13 , 12 . 50 , and 50 . 00 g / mL . These working solutions were used to determine the within - day and between - day accuracies and precisions . The between - day analyses were carried out by injecting the standard working solutions once per day for five consecutive days while the withinday analyses were done by injecting the standard working solutions five times on the same day . A separate standard curve was constructed on each day of the validation study .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 191}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 212}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 342}, "obj": "ne"}]}
