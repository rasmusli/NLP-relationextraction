After 24 h , 1 / 10th of the cell culture volume was used to inoculate the next virus passage . This process was continued for ten passages , at which time RNA was purified from the cellular supernatant , reverse transcribed , amplified using CVB3 - specific primers , and Sanger sequenced . Sequences were aligned to CVB3 parental genome and mutants were confirmed by manual chromatogram verification .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 34}, "obj": "ne"}]}
