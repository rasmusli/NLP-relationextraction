Increased sensitivity had provided new information about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the target pathogens . While these new assays have specific benefits for epidemiological investigations into the diseases of squirrels , it is hoped this work will have a wider impact by stimulating development of further multiplex qPCRs that will maximise information collected from investigations into multi - path systems , which are becoming increasingly important as knowledge of co - infection dynamics increases ( Telfer et al . 2010 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
