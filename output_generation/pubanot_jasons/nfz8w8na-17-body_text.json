A telephonebased survey in the Greater Toronto Area aiming to ascertain public perceptions of the use of quarantine found that while quarantine was perceived to be a necessary and effective strategy , its ethical implementation should involve the collaboration of policy - makers , public health organizations , and the general population , and should be closely regulated to ensure appropriate use and protection of individual rights ( Tracy et al . 2009 ) . Despite these recommendations , Toronto quarantined significantly more people during the SARS outbreak compared to the other affected cities , including Hong Kong and Shanghai ( Jacobs 2007 ) . Given the reported psychological distress reported by those quarantined , Toronto might have considered other strategies , such as the use of face masks to better Bdistribute the burden of containment measures ( Jacob , 2007 , p . 532 ) . Critics note that the extensive quarantining in Toronto lacked proper policies and procedures to guide its implementation ( Jacobs 2007 ) . Others highlight a lack of public record detailing any consultation between public health officials and the Ontario Human Rights Commission ( Jacobs 2007 ) . There was little public scrutiny , which was suggested to be the result of effective conditioning of the public consciousness to believe that quarantining recommendations would be made fairly and legitimately by senior public health officials ( Jacobs 2007 ) . Ultimately , it was not quarantining that was problematic , but the lack of apparent or sufficient evidence to guide its implementation . Beyond extensive quarantining , The World Health Organization issued travel - advisories as an additional control measure to contain further national and international spread of SARS from Toronto ( Paquin 2007 ) . This travel - advisory cost Toronto $ 1 . 1 billion and restricted the international right for freedom of movement ( Paquin 2007 ) . Paquin ( 2009 ) criticizes these travel - advisories for various reasons . For example , the advisories were not made by the WHO in consultation with Toronto authorities and led to an uneven global distribution of the burden of SARS ( Paquin 2007 ) . Furthermore , the travel advisories were based on old data resulting from delayed communication between the federal government of Canada and the WHO , as information had to first travel from municipal to provincial to federal health authorities ( Paquin 2007 ) . Once again , the evidence used to inform the response was outdated and therefore considered unjustified . As such , there were problems with both the lack of quality evidence and the travel advisory as a response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 22}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 225}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 253}, "obj": "ne"}]}
