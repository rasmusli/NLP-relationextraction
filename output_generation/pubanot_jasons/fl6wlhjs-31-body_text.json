Figure 3 shows some of these diagnostic plots for the Akron data ( the residuals plots for the other cities were similar ) . Except for a few extremely positive values , the estimated time series looks stationary . The normal approximation is good , as evidenced by the straight line on the normal quantile plot . The plots of the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrel functions of the time series innovations lie inside the dotted confidence bounds for a white noise process ( i . e . , are samples of uncorrelated time series errors ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
