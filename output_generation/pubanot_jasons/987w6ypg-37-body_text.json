Single - cycle infection - competent viruses were produced by co - transfection of 3 DNAs coding Gag - Pol , a miniviral genome coding GFP and Env ( for a 10 cm plate : 4 , 4 and 1 \u03bcg each , respectively ) and IFITMs were added at a Gag - Pol / IFITMs ratio of 1 to 3 . When indicated , this ratio was lowered to 1 to 0 , 07 by modifying the amount of IFITM transfected for a constant amount of Gag - Pol and Env coding DNAs . Media was replaced 12 hours after transfection and viral supernatants were collected 48 hours after . Supernatants were first centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 10 minutes , then filtered through a 0 , 45 \u03bcm syringe - filter , prior to purification by ultracentrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm for 2 hours through a 25 % ( w / v ) sucrose cushion . After ultracentrifugation , the pellet was resuspended in DMEM and normalized by either exogenous - RT activity or by an in - house anti - p24 ELISA , as described [ 39 ] . Viral infectivity was determined 3 days after cell challenge by flow cytometry analysis ( in the case of GFP - coding vectors ) or 24 hours PI by \u03b2 - gal assay in HeLaP4 cells ( stably expressing the CD4 / CXCR4 receptors plus an HIV - 1 - LTR - \u03b2 - gal reporter cassette , obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland ) with replicationcompetent HIV - 1 . The Env - Gag ratio of viral particles produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs was carried out by gp120 and p24 ELISA , as described [ 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 51}, "obj": "ne"}]}
