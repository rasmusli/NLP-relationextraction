The approach is based on biophysical principles in that far - UVC light can traverse and therefore inactivate bacteria and viruses which are typically micrometer dimensions or smaller , whereas due to its strong absorbance in biological materials , far - UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer dead - cell layers of human skin , nor the outer tear layer on the surface of the eye .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
