The nucleoprotein gene was the most conserved among all subgroups at the nt and aa levels . SH and G glycoprotein genes were more divergent between the HMPV subgroups at the nucleotide level with 76 and 63 % identity , respectively . The SH protein length was variable between group A and B strains due to a nucleotide substitution ( CAA \u2794 TAA ) at gene position 532 in group B , resulting in protein lengths of 178 and 180 aa , respectively . The predicted G protein length also varied among the different HMPV subgroups , between 219 and 241 aa , due to different positions of the Stop codon . Amino acid sequence diversity for G and SH glycoproteins is depicted in Fig . 2 and Additional file 2 : Figure S2 , respectively . The diversity of the complete nucleotide sequences of SH and G genes is depicted in phylogenetic trees in Fig . 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
