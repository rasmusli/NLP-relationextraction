An array of antiviral sialidase agents have been developed and are commercially available , such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating influenza . However , the development of bacterial sialidase inhibitors has been much less successful . Here , natural polyphenolic geranylated flavonoids which show significant inhibitory effects against Cp - NanI , a sialidase from Clostridium perfringens , are reported . This bacterium causes various gastrointestinal diseases . The crystal structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic domain in complex with the best inhibitor , diplacone , is also presented . This structure explains how diplacone generates a stable enzyme - inhibitor complex . These results provide a structural framework for understanding the interaction between sialidase and natural flavonoids , which are promising scaffolds on which to discover new anti - sialidase agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 58}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 349}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 365}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 533}, "obj": "ne"}]}
