As a control cells were transfected with dsRNA against GFP . Cell lysates were collected 48 hours post - transfection . Western blot was performed using anti - CxSTAT antibody . The results showed decreased STAT levels in cells transfected with WNV - NS1 or WNV - NS5 ( Fi 5D ) . The levels returned to baseline in cells also transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 . In WNV - NS3 transfected cells , there was no significant change in STAT level . These results indicate that WNV infection of Culex cells leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 , activated by WNV NS1 and NS5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
