In RNA structuredependent PRF , interaction of the stimulatory RNA with the ribosome impairs movement of the small subunit head during translocation , destabilizing the hybrid state and elevating energy barriers corresponding to subsequent substeps of translocation ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) . Completion of translocation is accelerated by slippage of tRNAs into the \u2212 1 frame , thus promoting PRF . At the PRRSV signal , the bound nsp1 \u2424 - PCBP complex would also be in close proximity to a ribosome actively decoding the slippery sequence , facilitating interactions between them . In this light , it may be significant that in pull down assays , nsp1 \u2424 has been shown to interact with rpS14 ( 34 ) , a protein immediately adjacent to a component ( rpS3 ) of the putative ribosome - associated mRNA unwinding activity ( 13 ) and PCBP1 is known to interact with RACK1 ( 41 ) , a ribosome - associated protein located close to the mRNA entry channel . Details of the molecular interactions that take place upon encounter of elongating ribosomes remain to be determined .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
