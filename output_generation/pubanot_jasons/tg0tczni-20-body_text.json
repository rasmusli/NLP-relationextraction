From which we could detect one major trend in the Axis 1 which accounted for 20 . 815 % of the total variation , and another major trend in the Axis 2 for 16 . 273 % of the total variation . A plot of the Axis 1 and the Axis 2 of each gene was shown in Additional file 1 , Figure S1 . Obviously , those polioviruses belong to the same genotype tends to come together ( except strain 48 , isolated from Finland ) . Compared with the scattered groups of polioviruses geno 1 , genotype 2 and 3 strains aggregated more tightly to some degree . Although this graph is a little complex , it seems that there is a clear geographical demarcation in the polioviruses genotype 1 such as the VDPV strains isolated from USA , Dominica , China mainland and Taiwan . These may indicate that geographic is another factor on codon usage bias .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
