RBM20 mediates alternative splicing of Ttn , resulting in increased expression of the shorter N2B isoform ( increased stiffness ) at the expense of the longer N2BA isoform ( Beraldi et al . 2014 ; Guo et al . 2013 ; Wyles et al . 2016 ) . RBM20 is also involved in alternative splicing of Mef2a , Znf451 , and Trdn ( Beraldi et al . 2014 ; Guo et al . 2013 ) , and is associated with altered expression of Nkx2 - 5 , Myl4 , Myl7 , Tnnt2 , Mybpc3 , and Actc1 ( Beraldi et al . 2014 ) . These changes in gene expression could be due to alternative splicing of MEF2A , which is likely to regulate the pulmonary myocardium gene network ( Table 4 ) . In knockout / - down studies , loss of RBM20 is associated with altered splicing and expression levels of . 200 genes , and the authors conclude that RBM20 underpins structural and functional development of cardiomyocytes ( Beraldi et al . 2014 ) . RBM20 is also likely to be an important regulator of the pulmonary myocardium molecular phenotype , is associated with NKX2 - 5 expression , and could be an important therapeutic target in atrial fibrillation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 79}, "obj": "ne"}]}
