First , the small sample size of the select critically ill patient population analyzed limits the general applicability of our findings . Moreover , since our study included critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy , our results may not be applicable to the majority of severe pneumonia patients in clinical practice . Second , the impact of antimicrobial therapy on the both BAL fluid cellular profiles and other inflammation markers such as procalcitonin , remains to be further elucidated . Third , cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis , Pneumoc jirovecii pneumonia , and mycobacterial pneumonia , were not included , mainly because few patients had these types of pneumonia . Fourth , patients with non - infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates that can often mimic infectious causes , such as acute respiratory distress syndrome , cryptogenic organizing pneumonia , eosinophilic pneumonia , and drug - induced pneumonitis , were also excluded from our analyses . The inclusion of those cases may have caused a marked decrease in the specificity of our BAL fluid criteria . Finally , all the pathogens were not directly identified from BAL fluid . Some patients were included in whom pathogens were identified by other means , such as blood culture , endotracheal aspirates culture , urinary pneumococcal antigen test , and PCR from nasopharyngeal samples , as long as clinically and radiographically compatible and no other etiology was demonstrated . Therefore , patients with coincidental upper respiratory infections or colonization may have been included .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 575}, "obj": "ne"}]}
