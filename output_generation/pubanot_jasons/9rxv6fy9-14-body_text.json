For example , a very low dose of 2 mJ / cm 2 of 222 - nm light inactivates > 95 % of airborne H1N1 virus . Our results indicate that far - UVC light is a powerful and inexpensive approach for prevention and reduction of airborne viral infections without the human health hazards inherent with conventional germicidal UVC lamps . If these results are confirmed in other scenarios , it follows that the use of overhead very low level far - UVC light in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne - mediated microbial diseases . Public locations such as hospitals , doctors ' offices , schools , airports and airplanes might be considered here . This approach may help limit seasonal influenza epidemics , transmission of tuberculosis , as well as major pandemics .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
