However , it is possible that these ICIs could be any number of host - derived functional structures that are typically observed as protein aggregates . Aggresomes , one such structure , are involved in shuttling of misfolded proteins during cellular stress [ 111 ] . Aggresomes are frequently observed as large intracellular aggregates of host proteins and are frequently surrounded by a \" cage \" of intermediate filament proteins . Available evidence suggests KD ICIs and aggresomes are distinct structures since the ICIs observed in the two autopsy specimens lacked a cytokeratin cage [ 103 ] . However , cytokeratin cages are not definitive of aggresomes and their presence may depend on the cell type . More frequently , vimentin is used as an intermediate filament marker for aggresomal cages . Because the expression of vimentin varies in bronchiole epithelial cells [ 112 ] , other common markers of aggresomes could have been studied , such as ubiquitin , HSP70 , HSP40 , and proteasomal subunits [ 111 ] . Unfortunately , none of these markers were tested . In addition , there are several other large intracellular protein aggregates such as stress granules , p - bodies , prion - aggregates , aggresome - like induced structures ( ALIS ) and autophagosomes [ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] . It is possible the ICI identified by antibodies A and J are one of these structures ; perhaps the manifestation of KD is the improper regulation of one of these processes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
