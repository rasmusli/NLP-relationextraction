Diagnosis is purely clinical , as there are no adequately specific or sensitive tests available . The ' classic ' diagnosis involves five days of fever and having four of the five following criteria : Mucous membrane inflammation , rash , hands and feet swelling , conjunctivitis , and a solitary inflamed lymph node mass [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . If left untreated , roughly one - quarter of the children meeting clinical criteria will go on to have coronary artery inflammation , including aneurysms . Incomplete cases , those which do not fulfill four of five of the classic criteria , have similar risk of coronary aneurysms [ 6 ] . Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) reduces the rates of coronary aneurysms , with a minority seemingly resistant to treatment [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . Although most aneurysms resolve , some defects are retained . Initial studies done on adults with a history of KD implies there is a greater lifetime risk of cardiac issues and early mortality [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . To add to the diagnostic confusion , several infectious etiologies have also been independently associated with aneurysms [ 15 ] . It remains a frustrating diagnosis because of the unknown etiology , clinical variability , lack of specific testing , and unclear pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
