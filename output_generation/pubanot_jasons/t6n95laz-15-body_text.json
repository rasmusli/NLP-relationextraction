CRP is able to activate complement and enhance phagocytosis to facilitate the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and injured , necrotic and apoptotic cells . Therefore , CRP is important in natural immunity ( 12 , 13 ) . Originally , CRP was considered to be a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation ; however , following ~ 10 years of investigation , it has been demonstrated that CRP participates in inflammation and atherosclerosis directly and has been indicated to be a prognostic factor and a risk factor ( 14 ) . In this study , it was revealed that levels of the precursor of CRP were decreased in the patients with CHB and markedly increased in the patients with ACLF . Nearly identical changes were observed for the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S - Wake , which has been implicated in in orphan diseases ( 15 ) , although not in liver diseases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
