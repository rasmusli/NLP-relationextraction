The data are too sparse over most of the range to know if this is due to repeat mutations at common loci or incomplete genetic sampling of the circulating H1N1 viruses . However , over the 2009 - 2010 H1N1 outbreak , Kedwaii , et al . [ 8 ] demonstrated near - complete lineage loss among the circulating viruses during a single season . Bedford , et al . [ 33 ] had similar results in their study of influenza A ( H3N2 ) . It was noted earlier that the p appears as a main trunk with many short - lived side branches . If most mutations are lost from the population quickly , variations that appear several times over the course of H1N1 are most likely due to mutations occurring multiple times in the same place . We do not have enough sequence data to get a full picture of strain diversity in most years , but this will be interesting to pursue as more data become available .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
