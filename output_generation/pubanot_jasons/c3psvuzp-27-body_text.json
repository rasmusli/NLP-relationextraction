However , recent studies on macro - PARPs implicate two candidate cellular processes . First , several PARP proteins ( PARPs 5a , PARP13 , PARP14 and PARP15 ) have been shown to be important for nucleation of stress granules in the cytoplasm , with ADP - ribosylation modulating miRNA activities [ 14 , 29 ] . This suggests that ADP - ribose in stress granules , or the miRNA functions that are altered by ADPribosylation , are targets for arms races with viruses . Stress granules have been shown to have antiviral properties stemming from mRNA sequestration , degradation and translational repression [ 60 ] . In contrast , several viruses localize to stress granules and employ them for replication [ 60 ] . Our model suggests that stress granule - associated PARP genes may be evolving to either combat the hijacking of stress granules or miRNA by viruses , or as direct mediators of the antiviral functions of stress granules or miRNAs . Alternatively , macro - PARPs may act at the level of gene expression , where ADP - ribosylation and macro - PARPs may influence transcription regulatory complexes . Indeed , after the initial discovery that PARP9 was highly expressed in aggressive Bcell lymphomas [ 61 ] , PARP9 and 14 were shown to regulate expression of several immunity - related genes [ 50 , 62 ] . Thus , one possible explanation for positive selection in the macro - PARP genes is that viral antagonists target them to prevent transcription of antiviral genes . Such viral antagonism could not only inform us of the role for macro - PARPs in the cells , but could also be used as a guide to devise useful interventions for treatment of the aggressive lymphomas that are associated with high PARP9 expression . Whether macro - PARPs are operating in stress granules or for antiviral transcription , or in both processes , our model suggest that host macrodomains , and ADP - ribosylation , play a critical role in formation of antiviral complexes , whereas viruses actively target these complexes for antagonism .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 452}, "obj": "ne"}]}
