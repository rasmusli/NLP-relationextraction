Then , five cases under different human movement pattern assumptions were investigated . Case 1 ~ 3 were used to simulate the cough when the index patient was seated at 9E , which is also the injection location . A no - movement case was used to simulate the aerosol dispersion in the airplane cabin without human movement . Two more cases were simulated to study the aerodynamic effects of human movement , in which the standing person started to move along the aisle 1 s after the aerosol injection at moving speeds of 0 . 5 m / s and 1 . 0 m / s , corresponding to stroll and normal walking , respectively . Case 4 and 5 simulated and compared the aerosol dispersion when the index patient walked in the airplane at 0 . 5 m / s and coughed at 3 s and 6 s after the Back and front surface Periodic Escape movement began , respectively . Since the aisle in the Boeing airplane is much longer than this computational geometry and the moving person may moves from a further area outside this computational geometry , the walking speed of the moving person can be assumed remain the same during the movement in this computational geometry [ 9 ] . The walking speed profile of the moving person is an even - speed profile [ 8 ] . The investigated cases are given in Table 4 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
