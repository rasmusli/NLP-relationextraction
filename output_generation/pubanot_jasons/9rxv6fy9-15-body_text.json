We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr - Cl gas mixture that predominantly emits at 222 nm 25 , 26 . The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described 15 . Each bandpass filter ( Omega Optical , Brattleboro , VT ) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of 25 nm and enables > 20 % transmission at 222 nm . A UV spectrometer ( SPM - 002 - BT64 , Photon Control , BC , Canada ) with a sensitivity range between 190 nm and 400 nm was utilized to verify the 222 nm emission spectrum . A deuterium lamp standard with a NIST - traceable spectral irradiance ( Newport Model 63945 , Irvine , CA ) was used to radiometrically calibrate the UV spectrometer . An SM - 70 Ozone Monitor ( Aeroqual , Avondale , Auckland , New Zealand ) measured the ozone generation from the lamps to be < 0 . 005 ppm , which is not a significant level to provide an antimicrobial effect to aerosolized viruses 27 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 72}, "obj": "ne"}]}
