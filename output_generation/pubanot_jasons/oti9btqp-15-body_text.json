The sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were collected at day 0 ( preimmunisation ) and week 6 ( 2 weeks post second immunisation ) . ELISpot analysis of pre - immunisation and week 6 PBMCs ex vivo stimulated with the ZIKV - prME peptide pools showed that ZIKV - prME immunisation induced robust anti - ZIKV T cell responses in RM ( Figure 4a ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
