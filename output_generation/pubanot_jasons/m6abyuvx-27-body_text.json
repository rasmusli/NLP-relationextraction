Importantly , rVV - N25 treatment did not cause liver injury based on the serum ALT levels ; therefore , this treatment was unlikely to have cytopathic effects on infected hepatocytes . These findings provided strong evidence that rVV - N25 treatment effectively halted the progression of chronic hepatitis . Immunization with plasmid DNA or with recombina vaccinia virus can effectively induce cellular and humoral immune responses and exert a protective effect against challenge with HCV infection [ 20 , 21 ] . However , findings from these previous studies revealed HCV immunization of both uninfected , na\u00efve animals and immune - tolerant animals induced a HCV - specific immune response . In the model describe here ; the animals were immune competent for HCV ; therefore , our findings provided further important evidence that rVV - N25 was effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 28}, "obj": "ne"}]}
