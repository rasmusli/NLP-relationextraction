Growing evidence indicates that DUB localization and activity are tightly controlled in vivo through proteinprotein interactions . Here , we highlighted recent progress in our understanding of how WDR proteins , WDR48 and WDR20 , interact with and activate USP12 and USP46 . Future studies should reveal if WDR48 and WDR20 expression or subcellular localization are regulated in neurons as a mechanism to control DUB function . Understanding how DUB function is regulated in vivo will provide critical information for the design of better drugs to fine - tune ubiquitin - regulation of protein trafficking or degradation of key proteins . Interestingly , although one human genetic study found no association between USP46 mutations and bipolar disorder or schizophrenia ( Kushima et al . , 2010 ) , another study identified USP46 as a candidate gene associated with early - onset essential tremor ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . It will be interesting to learn if mutations in USP46 or its regulators are associated with other neurological disorders given the importance of USP46 in both glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 72}, "obj": "ne"}]}
