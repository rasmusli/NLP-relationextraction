We selected 16 genes which are known to be involved in regulation of ion transport , almost all of which are also known susceptibility genes for arrhythmia ( Table 6 ) Wang et al . 1995 ) , and analyzed their expression in a publicly available mRNA microarray data set generated by Deshmukh et al . ( 2015 ) . This study used RNA extracted from left atrial appendage tissue obtained from cardiac surgery patients who were divided into three categories : those with atrial fibrillation who either were or were not in sinus rhythm at the time tissue samples were collected , and those with no history of atrial fibrillation . The patient cohorts represent susceptibility to atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation , respectively , when compared to control samples with no history of atrial fibrillation ( Deshmukh et al . 2015 ) . We compared our genes of interest ( Table 6 ) to expression changes in this data set to determine if genes in our network are likely to be n Table 4 ChIP - seq enrichment of Nkx2 - 5 , Srf , and Mef2a in genomic regions proximal to genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network and candidate upstream regulators dysregulated in atrial fibrillation . Of these 16 genes , four were significantly downregulated ( Cacna2d2 , 0 . 5 - fold ; Kcnj5 , 0 . 7 - fold ; Myoz2 , 0 . 7fold ; and Sln , 0 . 7 - fold ) and three were significantly upregulated ( Atp2a2 , 1 . 6 - fold ; Csrp3 , 1 . 8 - fold ; and Gja3 , 1 . 6 - fold ) in the persistent atrial fibrillation cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts ( Table 6 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 26}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 198}, "obj": "ne"}]}
