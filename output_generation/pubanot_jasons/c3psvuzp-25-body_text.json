However , in contrast to PARP4 , which we hypothesize is on the ' offense ' i . e . , specifically targeting viral proteins , the widely distributed pattern of positively selected sites within the macro - PARPs is reminiscent of other host immunity factors that are evolving on the ' defensive ' side ( i . e . , directly targeted by viral antagonists ) of evolutionary arms races [ 34 ] . In these cases , the host factor is performing a general antiviral function , such as shutting down host m translation in the case of the antiviral protein PKR ( Protein Kinase R ) , or transducing an antiviral transcriptional program as in the case of the antiviral protein MAVS ( Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling ) . As a result of their broad action , PKR and MAVS are antagonized by an array of proteins from diverse viral lineages that interact with different regions on the proteins [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 ] . The widely distributed pattern of positive selection in PKR [ 58 ] and MAVS [ 59 ] likely reflects this ' defense ' against ( or escape from ) multiple antagonists . We postulate that the dispersed pattern of selection we observe in PARP9 , 14 and 15 similarly reflects selection to escape recognition by a variety of distinct viral antagonists of a hypothesized PARPmediated antiviral response ( see below ) , rather than selection to maintain or establish recognition of viral target proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
