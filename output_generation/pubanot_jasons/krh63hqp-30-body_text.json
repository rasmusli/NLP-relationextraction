This was probably the basis for the extreme caution exhibited during the 2009 - 2010 H1N1 outbreak .

Note that the two decreasing in frequency over time are exactly matched by the two increasing over time ( i . e . , non - synonymous changes are having a negligible effect ) . Also , three of these lines ( GCA , GCC , and GCG ) indicate these codons are drifting even farther away from the human average . H1N1 might mutate into a stronger pathogen , and hence might create another catastrophic pandemic , as it did in 1918 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 535}, "obj": "ne"}]}
