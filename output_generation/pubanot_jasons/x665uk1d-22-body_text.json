Our observations and those of others on the effects of exogenous expression of RNase ( Pac1 and ISG20 ) and / or nuclease ( 3D8 scFv ) indicate that it is possible to develop transgenic plants and animal cells and even entire organisms that are virus - resistant . However , host RNA could be degraded nonselectively by 3D8 scFv R activity in 3D8 scFv - expressing cells . During the transformation process , antiviral transgenic cell lines or organisms can be developed if ( 1 ) the amount of 3D8 scFv protein expressed does not inhibit the physiological and developmental processes of cells or organisms , and ( 2 ) the amount of 3D8 scFv protein produced is sufficient to protect against virus infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
