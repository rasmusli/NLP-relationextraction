To determine whether the LDV - induced IFNa response [ 16 ] could be responsible for CD69 induction , we first utilized the fact that IFNa induces CD69 expression on B cells in vitro [ 19 ] . Splenic B cells were isolated from na\u00efve mice using CD19 + magnetic beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and cultured with 10 % plasma taken from mice infected 16 hours earlier with LDV . B cells cultured for 4 hours with plasma from infected , but not uninfected mice , significantly upregulated CD69 expression ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , upregulation of CD69 expression was prevented by addition of a neutralizing antibody specific for IFNa ( PBL Interferon Source ) in a concentrationdependent manner . These findings suggested that the IFNa response to LDV infection might be responsible for the partial activation of lymphocytes in vivo as well .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
