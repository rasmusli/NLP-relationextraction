The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region . Therefore , pandemic control is of highest importance to human health . Unfortunately , the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift . For example , the human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted influenza viruses [ 1 ] . Moreover , the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived \" permissible host \" . In particular , the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin ( HA ) gene from A / goose / Guangdong / 1 / 96 H5N1 and A / teal / Hong Kong / W312 / 97 H6N1 , while the internal genes were received from A / quail / Hong Kong / G1 / 97 H2N2 or A / teal / Hong Kong / W312 / 97 H6N1 , respectively [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken , its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds . This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level ( within the group of viruses ) and micro level ( within the group of strains ) using comparative phyloinformatics . This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial , temporal , and host dimensions , and therefore , allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis . However , corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved . Therefore , it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time . Furthermore , these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist - friendly . As a result , effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time , since specific local strains can be targeted directly .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
