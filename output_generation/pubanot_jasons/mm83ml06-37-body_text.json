Although the steady state amounts of Gag were not affected by the addition of DIs , the MHC - I antigen presentation as the final consequence of proteasomal degradation , was significantly enhanced . This finding is in concert with previous studies which show that an enhanced MHC - I antigen presentation did not necessarily correlate with the diminished half - life of Gag [ 26 , 48 ] . A possible explanation for this observation might be that just a minor fraction of Gag enters the UPS following treatment with DIs and this does not reduce the overall level of Gag that remains non - ubiquitinated . In consistency with this possibility is the notion that only a fraction of de novo synthesized proteins ( approx . 5 - 10 % ) are entering the DRiP - pathway [ 96 ] . Numerous studies show that targeting an antigen for degradation by the 26S proteasome represents a powerful approach to enhance MHC class I antigen presentation and to induce an efficient cytotoxic T - cell ( CTL ) - response [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] . We now show that also DIs can cause a significantly enhanced MHC class I antigen presentation of Gag - derived epitopes . Thus , it is legitimate to speculate that DIs not only reduce viral replication but might also induce a better CTL recognition of HIV - 1 + cells in vivo .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 192}, "obj": "ne"}]}
