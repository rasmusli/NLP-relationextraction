Our results here suggest that Culex STAT is regulated by Culex Cul4 ( mammalian Cul4A / B ortholog ) , which has proviral activity during WNV infection , and that WNV may target STAT for degradation by inducing Culex Cul4 via NS1 and NS5 proteins . Suppression of the mammalian interferon - mediated Jak - STAT pathway has been shown to be a common property of vector - borne flaviviruses . Dengue NS5 protein has been shown to target STAT2 for degradation [ 53 ] and WNV NS5 suppressed phosphorylation of STAT1 [ 54 ] , leading to decreased signaling in mammalian system . Interestingly , our results suggest that the mosquito Jak - STAT pathway is also targeted by WNV via cullin RING ubiquitin ligase . Although , we have identified WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins to be responsible for upregulation of Cul4 , the exact mechanism of this activation remains unknown . WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins have significantly different protein sequences , however both are involved in formation of viral replication complex . Studies are currently underway to determine whether this plays any part in the described mechanism . Our in vivo results also suggest that CxCul4 proviral activity may be mainly localized in the mosquito midgut and knockdown of CxCul4 increases Jak - STAT signaling in the midgut , thus decreasing the overall viral load in the body and , in turn , the saliva of these mosquitoes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
