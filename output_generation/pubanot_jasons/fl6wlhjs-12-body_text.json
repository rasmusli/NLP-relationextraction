They repeat this process for the visit counts instead of considering a joint modeling procedure . The detection algorithm filters one - step - ahead prediction errors [ 5 ] , and looks for values in this residual process that exceed a predetermined threshold . Their simulations are based on less realistic deterministic outbreak models . Ivanov , et al . [ 6 ] use the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average smoother to measure timeliness , sensitivity , and specificity of free - text chief complaints ( information describing patient ' s status on the ED visit ) . They indicate that the methods are good for detecting relatively large seasonal outbreaks , but not for small outbreaks . Burkom , et al . [ 7 ] extend this approach using Bayes Belief Networks to improve detection sensitivity and timeliness . There are also a number of wavelet - based and smoothing - based methods that can be used to monitor and detect abnormalities of unknown form , occurring over different time scales [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] . The use of scan statistics [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] has also gained popularity in recent years . Many of the methods based on scan statistics use fixed - effect models for biosurveillance ( also see , e . g . , [ 13 ] and [ 14 ] for other methods based on fixed - effect models ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
