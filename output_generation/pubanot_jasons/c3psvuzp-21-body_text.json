As such , numerous viruses manipulate host PTM machinery to regulate their own replication or evade host antiviral immunity . Research aimed at understanding these viral strategies has provided critical insight into the host processes mediated by PTMs , including tyrosine phosphorylation and regulation of histone acetylation [ 1 , 2 ] . Inspired by the fact that signatures of positive selection can be used to highlight important genes and PTMs in host - virus conflicts , we performed an evolutionary screen on all of the p PARP genes to ask if ADP - ribosylation is an important player in host - virus dynamics . Contrary to what would be expected of a PTM that is solely dedicated to housekeeping functions , we found strong evidence for rapid evolution in five of seventeen primate PARP genes , suggesting a broad involvement for PARPs , and ADP - ribosylation , in genetic conflicts . Moreover , we observed evolutionary signatures that suggested an ancient history of conflict for these PARP genes . For example , we see positive selection on PARP4 in diverse mammalian clades and recurrent gain and loss of PARP14 and PARP15 across vertebrates . Our findings suggest that PARP4 , 9 , 13 , 14 and 15 are each locked in a genetic conflict , likely with one or more pathogenic agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 413}, "obj": "ne"}]}
