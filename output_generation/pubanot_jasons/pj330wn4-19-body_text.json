The mean CBF values after 5 minutes exposure to pneumolysin determined by the ciliaFA was 21 . 45 \u00b1 4 . 1 Hz . Using the direct counting method , two different observers calculated a mean CBF of 21 . 75 \u00b1 4 . 5 Hz and 21 . 79 \u00b1 4 . 2 Hz respectively . Repeatability ( agreement between methods ) was very good and presented values similar to the agreement between two different observers ( 1 . 13 Hz and 1 . 08 Hz respectively ) . At 15 minutes after the addition of pneumolysin the cilia were mostly static ( Figure 2 ) . The ciliaFA accurately predicted the reduction in CBF and detected regions of interest where the cilia had become static .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 48}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 167, "end": 179}, "obj": "ne"}]}
