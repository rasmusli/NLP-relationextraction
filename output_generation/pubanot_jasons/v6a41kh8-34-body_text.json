However , the underlying reasons for the observed seasonal patterns demonstrated by these individual respiratory viruses are unclear . Climate could have a direct impact on virus survival , transmission efficiency , and host immunity , or have an indirect effect through climatedependent behavior change , such as indoor crowding and eating habits [ 55 ] . We detected more than one virus in 3 . 3 % of the virus - positive NPA specimens , which is similar to what is reported using molecular methods detecting the same viruses as in our study [ 56 ] , but lower compared with studies using molecular methods detecting a wider array of viruses [ 57 , 58 ] . The frequency of viral co - detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [ 59 ] and the number of pathogens tested for [ 58 ] . By employing multiplex PCR assays for 11 viruses , a study in 515 Korean children aged \u2264 5 years detected viruses in 312 ( 60 . 6 % ) of cases and a viral co - detection in 36 ( 11 . 5 % ) [ 45 ] . In addition to the seven viruses identified in our study , the Korean study also detected adenovirus , coronavirus , rhinovirus , and bocavirus ; and , notably , the last virus was identified in 22 of the 36 co - detections . The clinical role of bocavirus in pneumonia in otherwise healthy children is unclear [ 60 , 61 ] , as is the importance of multiple viral infections [ 57 , 59 ] . Quantitative PCR methods to determine viral load in clinical specimens could provide valuable information on the pathogenetic role of each virus in such co - detections [ 61 ] , as could case - control studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
