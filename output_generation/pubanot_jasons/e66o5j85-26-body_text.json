Fifty - one ( 43 . 2 % ) received oxygen for a median length of 2 days ( IQR : 1 - 3 days ) , and 3 ( 2 . 5 % ) had blood transfusions . Three patients with pleural effusions were tested for microbial detection . Five patients died ( lethality : 4 . 2 % ) ; death was directly related to pneumonia in 4 patients ( Table 2 ) . Table 1 compares the clinical signs and symptoms at admission between cases and controls , underlying conditions and biological findings . Pneumonia cases differed from controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms as well as vital signs at admission , but not in terms of demographic factors or past medical history . Pneumonia cases were more frequently hypoxemic ( defined as oxygen saturation < 90 % ) at admission than the controls ( 30 . 5 % vs . 0 % , P < 0 . 001 ) . PCV coverage was zero in both groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 88}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 125}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 177}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 213}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 250}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 313}, "obj": "ne"}]}
