The developed method was used to quantify the amount of lycorine in extracts of various parts of the H . littoralis wild and tissue culture samples . Lycorine contents in those samples were calculated using external standard method and summarized in Table 2 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) . On the other hand , the contents of lycorine in extracts of callus samples are given in Table 3 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figure 1 ( c ) . The wild plant extract and callus ( initiated from 4 . 5 M 2 , 4 - D alone and 9 . 00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4 . 5 M BAP combination ) were statistically analyzed . There was significant production of lycorine in callus compared to wild type plant extract .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 91}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 185}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 413}, "obj": "ne"}]}
