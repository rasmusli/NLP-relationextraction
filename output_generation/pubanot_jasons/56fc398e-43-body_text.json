Of course , this creates something of a conundrum - in order to sample the most highly connected nodes , and thus accurately represent epidemic risk on an unknown network , one needs to know which farms have the most movements . One solution to this would be for all farmers to be required to record the number of movements they make in a given year . These summary statistics could then be used to determine which farms should be sampled for the following year . In the UK , at least , analysis of the movement network for multiple years suggests that those farms that have a high number of movements in a given year are more likely to have a high number of movements in the following year . This method may therefore be used in countries where livestock movement data are not currently available in order to inform epidemic models and predict the potential for disease spread owing to animal movements in the early stages of a disease outbreak .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
