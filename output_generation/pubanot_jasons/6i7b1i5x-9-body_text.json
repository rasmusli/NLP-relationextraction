Treatment with IVIG in KD patients can inhibit coronary aneurysm formation , implying a role for antibodies in disease pathogenesis . However , it is unclear how IVIG actually functions in this setting and if specific antibody responses are responsible for pathogenesis . Potential functions of IVIG include : Replacement for deficient specific protective antibody , anti - idiotype response against pathologic antibodies , B cell downregulation , upregulation of regulatory T cells , down of neutrophil function , downregulation of dendritic cell function , and superantigen neutralization . Recent reviews have explored these functions [ 58 , 59 ] . The main treatment modalities used for refractory treatment are steroids , calcineurin inhibitors , and anti - TNF monoclonal antibodies ; all of which have broad immunological effects [ 60 , 61 ] . Success with anti - TNF monoclonal antibodies seemingly argues against a significant role of B cells , as this would effectively release a suppressive action of TNF on B cell proliferation . However , calcineurin inhibition would have the opposite effect by limiting T - cell help to B cells [ 62 ] . Limited reports of treatment with anti - B cell monoclonal antibodies ( anti - CD20 ) also support a role for B cell activation in KD pathogenesis [ 63 ] . Interluekin - 1 ( IL 1 ) , has long been known to affect B cell activity [ 64 ] , but it has a very broad array of inflammatory responses [ 58 ] . Notably , there is support in the lactobacillus casei mouse model for IL - 1 playing a role [ 65 ] . Applicable clinical trials are listed in Table 1 .
