Additional file 1 includes these data on a segment - by - segment basis . Figure 5 illustrates a continuous decline in the Ti / Tv ratio during the entire history of the human H1N1 lineage . This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversion over time , perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as extinction approaches . A transversion is 2 . 7 times more likely to cause a non - synonymous change than a transition , and is also more likely to change RNA 3 - dimensional configuration . Since we do not see a change in the rate of accumulation of amino acid substitutions over time ( Figure 3 ) , we suspect that the heightened selection against transversions may be more strongly associated with RNA architectural constraints .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
