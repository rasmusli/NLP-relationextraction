Local public health centre ( LPHC ) and emergency medical services ( EMS ) personnel responded to the outbreak by conducting initial interviews with suspected cases , transporting patients and specimens and managing contacts . Responders in contact with patients used different levels of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . Full - protection PPE includes a gown , N95 respirator , gloves and goggles . As the transmissibility of MERS is unclear , 3 it is possible that responders were infected by being exposed to MERS patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
