This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the RT and the PR open reading frame , causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) and most PR inhibitor [ 63 ] ( Figure 6E ) . To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV - 1 4lig7 , HLAC were infected with HIV - 1 4lig7 virus preparations standardized for p24 , and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR - 619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A - D ) . Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose - dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV - 1 field isolate , as it was observed for HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 .

Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose - dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV - 1 field isolate , as it was observed for HIV - 1NL4 - 3 . Previously , it was demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV - 1 Gag processing and virus infectivity [ 38 ] . Moreover , it has been shown that proteasome inhibitors block the replication capacity of HIV - 1 in cell culture [ 64 ] . Both inhibitors , proteasome inhibitors and DIs , induce the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins , albeit by different mode of action . Thus , it was intriguing to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors in combination with DIs would generate synergistic effects on HIV - 1 replication capacity . Therefore , HLAC were infected with HIV - 1NL4 - 3 and replication studies were performed as described above ( see Figure 4 ) . Following permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR - 619 or P22077 together with 0 . 6 nM of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib , specific for the constitutive proteasome [ 65 ] , significant reduction in replication capacity was observed ( Figure 7A , C ) . Similar results were obtained after permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR - 619 or P22077 and 10 nM PR - 957 , which is a specific inhibitor of the immunoproteasome [ 66 ] ( Figure 7E , G ) . In contrast , individual treatment with each DI or proteasome inhibitor alone had no influence on virus replication at this concentration range . Cell viability was assessed by WST - 1 assay showing that all applied substances had no impact on cell viability in any individual or combinatory treatment scheme ( Figure 7B , D , F , H ) . Together , these results reveal a synergistic antiretroviral activity of inhibitors that act on both components of the UPS , proteasomes and DUBs .
