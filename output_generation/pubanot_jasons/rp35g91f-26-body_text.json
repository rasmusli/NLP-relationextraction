The expression level of all transcripts varied by greater than twofold between BXD strains ( Table 2 ) . All transcripts except one ( Sln , sarcolipin ) had either a suggestive ( LRS . 10 . 4 ) or significant ( LRS . 17 ) eQTL that mapped to the hotspot regions on Chr1 and Chr2 identified in the cluster map ( Table 2 ) . One transcript , Myh6 ( myosin heavy chain 6 , Chr14 ) , varied by 2 . 62 - fold between the highest and lowest expressing BXD strains ( Figure 2B ) , such that a significant trans eQTL could be mapped to Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb ( Figure 2C ) . Of the remaining transcripts , 11 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb region ( Table 2 ) . Two additional transcripts had significant eQTL mapping to Chr1 ( Doc2g , Chr19 ; Trnd , Chr10 ) but these did not overlap and were not replicated in more than one other transcript ( Table 2 ) . Two transcripts , Kcnj3 and Tnni3 ( Chr2 and Chr7 , respectively ) , had overlapping significant eQTL on Chr2 . For example , Tnni3 expression varied by 2 . 35fold between strains ( Figure 2D ) and a trans eQTL was mapped to Chr2 : 68 . 8 6 0 . 4 Mb ( Figure 2E ) . Of the remaining transcripts , 12 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr2 : 68 . 8 6 0 . 4 Mb region ( Table 2 ) . A second eQTL peak on Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb also reached significance for one gene ( Mybpc3 , Chr2 ) and was a suggestive eQTL for seven additional transcripts ( Table 2 ) . Using the Tnni3 eQTL plot as an example , this Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb region had a suggestive LRS ( Figure 2F ) . Since three significant eQTL intervals ( Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb , Chr2 : 68 . 8 6 0 . 4 Mb , and Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb ) were mapped with suggestive LRS in multiple pulmonary myocardium transcripts , the genes within these regions were interrogated to identify putative upstream regulatory genes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 334}, "obj": "ne"}]}
