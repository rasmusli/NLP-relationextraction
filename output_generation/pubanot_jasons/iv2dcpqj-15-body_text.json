To examine the effects of eEF1A on the NS5A - mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity , the luciferase reporter assay was used in this study . The results showed that eEF1A ( Figure 5A ) , as well as NS5A ( Figure 5B ) , inhibited the CSFV IRES activity in a dose - dependent manner . To further investigate the inhibitory effects of eEF1A and NS5A coexpression , eEF1A - and NS5A - expressing plasmids were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids into HEK293T cells . The results indicated that the eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A when NS5A and eEF1A were coexpressed ( Figure 5C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 34}, "obj": "ne"}]}
