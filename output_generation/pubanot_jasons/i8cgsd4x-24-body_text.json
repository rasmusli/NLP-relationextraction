Microarray studies have also shown that several ubiquitin - related genes are induced following infection in mosquito cells [ 32 ] . The ubiquitinproteasomal pathway is one of the major pathways involved in post - translational modifications , leading to degradation of proteins . It has also been implicated in various stages of viral infection in mammalian cells including virus entry , replication and exit [ 49 ] . The largest family of ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) is a group of proteins that contain a RING domain , a structural motif comprising eight cysteine and histidine residues that form the interface with E2 ( ubiquitin conjugating ) enzyme [ 18 ] . Substrate specificity is determined by variant RING ubiquitin ligases and also by multiprotein complexes that contain a conserved RING protein . Cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are one such family of proteins , containing eight mammalian members , each with different substrate specificity [ 22 ] . These proteins have been implicated in many cellular processes including cell - cycle regulation and cell signaling . Because of this , cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are frequently targeted by viruses to evade host immunity [ 33 ] . Viruses redirect these ligases to select specific host proteins for degradation in order to prevent the host response and promote viral replication and dissemination . For example , viruses have been shown to use cullins to prevent cellular apoptosis by degrading p53 [ 50 ] or inhibit the innate antiviral response by blocking interferon signaling [ 30 ] . In mammals , interferon is a key component of a major innate defensive response against invading viruses by activating Jak - STAT pathway and the expression of antiviral genes in neighbouring cells [ 51 ] . Some members of the Paramyxoviridae have been shown to hijack cullin4A ubiquitin ligase complexes to overcome the interferon response , by promoting degradation of STAT proteins . Specifically , the V protein of simian virus 5 causes degradation of STAT1 [ 29 ] , while the parainfluenza virus V protein causes degradation of STAT2 via the Cul4A substrate adaptor DDB1 [ 52 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 396}, "obj": "ne"}]}
