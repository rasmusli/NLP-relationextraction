As p53 is known as an important anti - cancer protein , these proteins could be related to cancer development . For instance , API5 was enriched in this network , and the API5 expression level was reduced in F81 cells at 48 hpi and 60 hpi . API5 is an apoptosis inhibitory protein that can suppress E2F - dependent apoptosis 44 . It is frequently up - regulated in tumour cells and functions as a master regulator of immune escape genes in tumours 45 . Based on these findings , CPV may be a powerful apoptosis - modulating agent that could down - regulate API5 gene expression .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
