Fig 3A indicates that the numbers of coinfected cases of HRV , HPIV - 3 , and adenovirus were significantly higher than that of single infection cases , generating significant P values of 0 . 0001 , 0 . 009 , and 0 . 0001 , respectively . In cases of RSV , HMPV , and HBoV , no significant differences in frequency were observed between cases of single infections and coinfections for each viral agent . We also analyzed coinfect status in terms of bacterial pathogens . As we can see in Fig 3B , the numbers of cases where S . pneumoniae and K . pneumoniae had been found as coinfection partners were 17 ( n = 18 ) and 10 ( n = 11 ) , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
