Examples can be discovered in DNA viruses , retroviruses and RNA viruses . DNA viruses , which replicate in the nucleus , have been extensively investigated in regard to control the cell cycle of host cells . For example , some small DNA viruses including simian virus 40 ( DeCaprio et al . , 1988 ) , adenovirus ( Howe et al . , 1990 ; Eckner et al . , 1994 ) , and human papillomavirus ( Werness et al . , 1990 ) , which lack their own polymerases , use the host polymerase to promote the entry of cells into S phase from G0 / G1 phase . For other large DNA viruses , for example , herpesviruses can induce G0 / G1 arrest in order to avoid competing for cellular DNA replication resources ( Flemington , 2001 ) . Cell cycle regulation also has been observed for retroviruses , which , like DNA viruses , replicate in the nucleus . The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is responsible for eliciting cell cycle arrest in G2 / M phase ( He et al . , 1995 ; Goh et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore , RNA viruses , whose primary site of replication is normally the cytoplasm , have also been demonstrated to interfere with the host cell cycle . Infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) induces an S and G2 / M - phase arrest to favor viral replication ( Dove et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2007 ) , and mouse hepatitis virus ( MHV ) ( Chen and Makino , 2004 ) and some severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) proteins induce cell cycle arrest in G0 / G1 phase ( Yuan et al . , 2005 ( Yuan et al . , , 2006 . In a previous study , we found that human EV - A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 , manipulate the host cell cycle at S phase in order to promote their own viral replication ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) ; however , the potential manipulation of the host cell cycle by EV - D68 , which is associated with higher lethality in recent large - scale outbreaks , has not been previously characterized .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
