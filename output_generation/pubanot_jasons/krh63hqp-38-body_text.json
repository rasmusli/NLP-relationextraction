First , since the frequency of codon usage is positively correlated with tRNA availability in the cell [ 64 ] , the increased use of rare codons is expected to negatively affect protein translation rates . Alternatively , Li , et al . [ 65 ] did not notice any decrease in translational efficiency based on codon choice in bacteria , but they did see effects caused by mutation towards other genomic control motifs ( i . e . , anti - Shine Dalgarno sequences ) . Part of codon bias deals with a cell ' s avoidance of controlling factors that do not directly deal with translation rates ( e . g . , CG dinucleotides ) . Thus , there are multiple ways a disruption of codon bias might negatively impact the functionality of a particular stretch of any nucleic acid . Second , even though the codon usage in ducks and humans is similar [ 51 ] , although less so for swine [ 52 ] , this might affect the ability of a virus to cross species lines ( after cellular antigenic recognition is taken into account ) . Third , Anhlan , et al . [ 51 ] entertained several hypotheses , including that the virus was avian in origin but transferred to pigs before it jumped to humans . Our data clearly indicate that all H1N1s studied are more duck - like in their codon usage , although we cannot comment about a prehuman swine intermediate based on our data . Finally , since we see an obvious decay in codon bias over time when compared to codon usage in either human , duck , or pig , it is clear that H1N1 is not evolving toward optimal codon usage in any of these species but is slowing drifting away from optimal translational efficiency . We concur with Anhlan , et al . that , \" the issue of codon usage seems to be much more important at least for influenza viruses than previously thought . \"", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 299}, "obj": "ne"}]}
