For example , in Japan , they become more active between winter and spring for migration and reproduction [ 15 , 16 ] . It is well known that C . nigribarbis has excellent flight capacity and high dispersal ability . They have been identified by weather ships at stations located on the Pacific Ocean and East China Sea , 300 - 450 km from Kyushu Island , Japan [ 17 ] . It was also suggested that the number of flies found in autumn in the Kyushu District appears to increase due to their transoceanic migration [ 18 ] . Female blow flies can survive for about one year in Japan [ 17 ] , in comparison to the house fly Musca domestica which has a mean longevity of 34 . 2 days [ 19 ] . The longevity and high dispersal ability of blow flies may also result in wide dispersion of viruses that they carry . Mark - release - recapture experiments conducted at Tamba Town in 2005 suggested that C . nigribarbis generally could migrate up to 2 - 3 km in 24 h [ 20 ] . The distance between the two poultry farms in Kyoto prefecture , where the two H5N1 virus outbreaks took place in 2004 , was approximately 4 km . In fact , 10 % of all C . nigribarbis flies collected at a site intermediate between the affected farms expressed H5N1 virus genes [ 11 ] . Viable titers of H5N1 influenza virus , but not virus replication , were detected for up to 24 h in the crop and intestine of virus - exposed C . nigribarbis [ 10 ] . The presence of infectious virus in blow flies for 24 h could have a strong implication for virus dispersion since blow flies , with their excellent flight capacity , could transport the H5N1 virus over significant distances . In addition , H5N1 virus has been isolated from feces and vomit matter of blow flies at the 48 h postexposure , but virus titers in flies at 48 h were lower than that of the virus - containing cotton used in these experiments . This suggested that the viability of influenza virus decreases steadily in the blow fly crop and intestine , although some infectious virus remains for longer than 24 h . Therefore , C . nigribarbis could transport H5N1 virus to poultry farms 2 - 3 km apart .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
