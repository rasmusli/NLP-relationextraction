The options are presented in a parameter output panel and translated into command line string for calling the underlying ClustalW program upon execution of the workflow . After the completion of ClustalW , an output file is produced on the local hard disk at a specified location containing the aligned data set . This file name and its location is the input for the next component ( e . g . Seqboot ) . The remaining components , e . g . Seqboot with its underlying PHYLIP operate in the same way .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
