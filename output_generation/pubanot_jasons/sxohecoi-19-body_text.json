Using IgG from cervicovaginal fluid of three HIV - infected women and from seminal fluid of three infected men , enhanced transcytosis occurred at IgG concentrations well within their expected range in genital tract secretions ( Figure 4A and 4B ) [ 18 ] . The ability of genital tract IgG to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG ( Spearman ' s r = 0 . 94 , p = 0 . 005 ; Figure 4C ) and less so with binding to monomeric Env glycoprotein from the same virus strain ( HIV - 1 US657 ) ( rho = 0 . 65 , p = 0 . 16 ; Figure S6 ) . None of the genital tract IgGs were able to neutralize HIV US657 , the clinical R5 strain used in these experiments , at IgG concentrations as high as 50 mg / ml ( not shown ) . Consistent with HIVIG and the non - neutralizing mAbs , higher concentrations of genital tract IgGs generally resulted in greater infectivity of the transcytosed virus ( Figure 4D and 4E ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
