For instance , PARP4 is a component of large cytoplasmic structures known as vaults , whose functions are poorly understood . Although vaults are extremely ancient , dating back to the origin of eukaryotes , they have been lost in multiple lineages [ 9 ] , suggesting that they are not universally necessary to perform an essential , housekeeping function . Instead , there are several tantal pieces of evidence that vaults may be involved in immunity . These include an increased number of vaults in immune cell types , IFN - upregulation of MVP , the major component of vaults , and upregulation of noncoding vault RNAs ( vRNAs ) on infection with pathogens such as Epstein - Barr virus [ 45 ] . PARP4 itself is present at , 10 molecules per vault , but its functional role there is unknown [ 44 ] . However , our observation that the positively selected residues we find in PARP4 are localized to a single disordered region in PARP4 suggests a model for its role in vault - mediated immunity . Such a localized pattern of positively selected sites is reminiscent of two well - characterized rapidly evolving antiviral factors , TRIM5a and MxA , shown to be on the ' offensive ' ( i . e . directly binding to viral proteins ) side of the host - virus conflict [ 34 ] . TRIM5a and MxA both use their rapidly evolving regions , also in the context of multimeric complexes , to directly recognize and target viral proteins , lentiviral capsids in the case of TRIM5a and orthomyxovirus nucleoproteins in the case of MxA [ 35 , 36 ] . Thus , we infer that the positively selected region of PARP4 ( exon 30 in humans ) has evolved to maintain recognition of a factor encoded by pathogens that can infect many diverse mammalian lineages , or is a common means to counteract independent unrelated pathogens . This interaction may be used to directly ADPribosylate viral components , which could affect their activity and impede infection . Alternatively , independent of ADP - ribosylation , PARP4 interaction may recruit viral proteins to the vault structures within virally infected cells , wherein the vault proteins might sequester viral proteins and thereby impede their infectivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
