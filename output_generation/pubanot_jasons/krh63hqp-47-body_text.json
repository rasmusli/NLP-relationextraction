The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago , and there has been universal extinction of all earlier human influenza strains . The rate of mutational divergence from that original genotype has been very constant both in human and porcine H1N1 strains ( roughly 14 - 16 mutations fixed per year ) . Modern H1N1 strains have diverged from the original genotype by roughly 1 , 900 fixations ( more than 15 % of the genome has muta ) . Roughly 7 % of the amino acids have mutated . Mutation accumulation is also associated with the historical exponential decline in H1N1 human mortalities , which may suggest significant genetic attenuation , as might arise due to very slow error catastrophe .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
