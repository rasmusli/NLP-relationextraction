To overcome this obstacle and to reduce the cost , extremely powerful neutralizing mAbs which can be given in smaller doses without compromising the efficacy is needed . One strategy to achieve this could be to design humanized mAbs with exceptional binding attraction and targeting them against the potential targets , such as RBD .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
