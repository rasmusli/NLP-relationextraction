This strong antiviral effect on TBEV is mediated by targeting the virus at multiple steps of the life cycle . Interestingly , viperin targeting the synthesis of plus - sense RNA is dependent on the SAM domain or the C - terminal domain , while the N - terminal domain of viperin is responsible for interfering with virus assembly and release .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 25}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 259}, "obj": "ne"}]}
