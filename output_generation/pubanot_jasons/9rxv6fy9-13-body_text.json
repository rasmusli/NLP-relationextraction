For example , while there will almost certainly be variations in UVC inactivation efficiency as different influenza strains appear , they are unlikely to be large 7 , 10 . Likewise , as multi - drug - resistant variants of bacteria emerge , their UVC inactivation efficiencies are also unlikely to change greatly 9 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
