The Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb interval contained nine genes , with five of these ( Prim2 , Rab23 , Bag2 , Z , and Dst ) expressed in adult lung ( Table 3 ) . Both Rab23 and Zfp451 have known functions that could implicate them in regulating gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium network . RAB23 , a GTPase of the RAB family involved in vesicular trafficking , also exerts downstream transcriptional effects by antagonizing the action of the transcription factor GLI1 ( Sun et al . 2012 ) . However , the function , localization , and mechanisms of action of RAB23 are still largely undefined . On the other hand , ZFP451 ( zinc finger protein 451 ) is a promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body - associated transcriptional coregulator , and modulates transcription by regulating protein subnuclear localization ( Karvonen et al . 2008 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
