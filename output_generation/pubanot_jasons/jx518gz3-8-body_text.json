However , no studies have been reported on the possible role of flies in transmission of H5N1 influenza virus . Therefore , an entomological survey was conducted in March 2004 to investigate the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 virus , using flies collected from around the infected poultry farm in Tamba Town for virus detection and isolation . Blow fly collection was carried out on 10 - 11 March 2004 , just after the H5N1 outbreak at poultry farm B [ 11 ] . A sunny place protected from strong wind was selected , and rotten fish bait was placed on the ground . A total of 926 flies were collected within a 2 . 3 km radius of poultry farm A in Tamba Town ( Figure 2 ) , representing eight fly species with > 80 % of the collected flies identified as either Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven or Aldrichina grahami ( Aldrich ) ( Figure 3 ) . Influenza A virus matrix protein ( M ) and hemagglutinin ( HA ) genes were detected in the intestinal organs , crop , and gut of C . nigribarbis and A . grahami by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) [ 11 ] . The prevalence of H5 subtype virus ( 20 - 30 % ) was higher in flies of both species collected 600 - 700 m from poultry farm A and lower ( 10 % ) in flies collected > 2 km from poultry farm A . We found that nearly 5 % of C . nigribarbis collected around the affected areas contained infectious H5N1 viruses . viral M , HA , and NA genes were amplified by PCR with universal primers , full - length sequences were analyzed , and sizes were found to be 991 , 1 , 707 , and 1 , 362 bp , respectively . These sequences showed high similarity to those of strains from chickens ( A / chicken / Kyoto / 3 / 2004 ) and crows ( A / crows / Kyoto / 53 / 2004 ) isolated during the 2004 outbreaks in Kyoto , with > 99 . 9 % identity for all three genes . The virus from C . nigribarbis ( A / blow fly / Kyoto / 93 / 2004 ) was characterized as an H5N1 subtype influenza A virus based on neuraminidase gene ( NA ) sequences . In addition , the HA1 - HA2 connecting peptide sequence in the HA gene segment was RERRRKKR \u2193 G . Finally , virus isolated from C . nigribarbis was characterized as a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype influenza A virus .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
