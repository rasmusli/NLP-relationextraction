Rapid detection of these viruses would enhance the outbreak response . We reported the prevalence of multiple HAdV types ( HAdV - B , HA - C , HAdV - D HAdV - E ) in paediatric patients with SARI in China from 2007 to 2010 ( overlapping the H1N1 pandemic period ) . Consistent with previous reports [ 6 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] , the HAdV - B and HAdV - C were the most common serotypes for ARI , and co - infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent ( 64 from 76 , especially co - infection with RSV , HRV , HBoV and PIV3 ) . And 32 from 76 were co - infected by two or more viruses . The previous studies on co - infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV were limited . Our data showed the higher number of co - infection might be resulted from samples ( from the severe paediatric patients ) and method ( molecular detection for multiple viruses , optimized SOP . . . . ) . Because of the high co - infection The severity of infection associated with HAdV varies depending on the different HAdV types [ 10 , 15 ] . In addition , the prevalence of different HAdV serotypes varies among different geographical regions [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] . Our study indicated that HAdV was frequently detected in SARI children from 2008 to 2010 ( 52 / 259 , 20 . 1 % ) in Northern China ; this frequency was higher than that of cases in Eastern China ( 24 / 293 , 8 . 2 % ) and in other studies [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] 19 ] . The reasons for the marked differences are unknown . We suggest that the cause may be the difference in species of the sample as well as the disease severity in the population studied . However , further investigation is needed . Furthermore , among the 76 HAdV samples , 25 ( 32 . 9 % ) were identified as HAdV - 7 ( HAdV - B ) , and 15 ( 19 . 7 % ) as HAdV - 3 ( HAdV - B ) , representing the most common molecular types . Previous studies have found that HAdV - B was the most common species in southern China [ 26 ] , and HAdV - 3 was the predominant type of HAdV - B . And another study reported HAdV - 3 ( HAdV - B ) outbreak associated with febrile respiratory disease in Eastern China in 2011 [ 27 ] . In the present study the most dominant HAdV - C strains were HAdV - 1 ( 11 , 14 . 47 % ) , followed by HAdV - 2 ( 9 , 11 . 84 % ) , and HAdV - 5 ( 8 , 10 . 52 % ) . Other HAdV - C types including HAdV - 6 , HAdV - 2 / 6 and HAdV - 57 , as well as HAdV - D ( HAdV - 37 ) and", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
