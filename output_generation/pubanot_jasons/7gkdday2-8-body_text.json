The bacterial pathogens were then isolated using selective media including MacConkey Agar , Blood Agar with Gentamicin , and Chocolate Agar . After morphology - dependent selection , colonies were identified by specific tests where necessary such as , optochin sensitivity and bile solubility tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae , tests for requirement of growth factors X , V and XV for Haemophilus influenzae and appropriate biochemical tests including T ( Triple Sugar Iron ) , Citrate , MIU ( Motility Indole Urea ) media , and Analytical Profiling Index API 1 20E ( bioM\u00e9rieux , St . Louis , USA ) for Enterobacteriaceae like Klebsiella pneumoniae . Profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility / resistance was performed by the modified disc diffusion method and the bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of inhibition zone interpretative chart , published in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute ( CLSI ) guidelines 2014 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 24}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 234}, "obj": "ne"}]}
