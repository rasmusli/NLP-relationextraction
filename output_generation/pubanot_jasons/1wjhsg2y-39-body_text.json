Notably , ongoing armed conflict in several Western Asia countries , ranging from war in Afghanistan , Syria , and Yemen to political instability in Iraq and Lebanon to Islamist militancy in Pakistan [ 131 ] , threaten the safety of wildlife researchers and have deprioritized government investments in wildlife or zoonotic disease research . Tragically , these conflicts have also directly impacted wildlife researchers , including the murder of a prominent mammalogist ( and bat researcher ) in Syria for unknown reasons [ 132 ] , as well as the continued imprisonment of nine Iranian researchers on suspicion of espionage , a crime punishable by death , for using camera traps to monitor the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah [ 133 ] . On the other hand , socio - political turbulence in the region has driven an increase in international concern for global health security . Yet , despite investments by local and foreign governments to support biosafety and biosecurity programs in the region , there remains limited capacity and unequal access to critical infrastructure and resources to improve biosurveillance across Western Asia [ 134 ] . Furthermore , until very recently , this region was a low priority for wildlife research funding , and what funding was available for wildlife research was targeted to the conservation of more charismatic species ( e . g . , Arabian Oryx , Asiatic cheetah ) .
