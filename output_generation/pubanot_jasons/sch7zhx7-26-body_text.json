To determine whether our CVB3 mutants had fitness enhancement manifesting as a more rapidly replicating virus , we measured virus plaque sizes of wildtype and protease mutant virus . We observed no significant difference between wildtype and mutant CVB3 plaque size ( Figure 3D ) . To better measure viral fitness via competition assay , we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A 29K or 3C 52R , and after five passages , we extracted RNA , reverse transcribed , amplified viral genomes by PCR , and Sanger sequenced the appropriate genomic locus corresponding to each protease ( Table 1 ) . After the fifth passage , we observed that the wildtype and either protease mutant virus existed as a mixed population , with peaks corresponding to the wildtype and mutant nucleotide present in the samples ( Figure 3E , representative of three independent passages ) . Additionally , we passaged mutant virus without competition to determine the stability of the mutant . We observed that the mutation was maintained after five passages , suggesting that there is no fitness cost to this mutation in our cell culture conditions . Altogether , our data suggest that protease - mutant CVB3 exhibits no significant replicative advantage compared to wildtype CVB3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
