This study demonstrates that virus can be shed in faeces for an extended period of up to 14 weeks from diagnosis . Faecal shedding of vaccine virus was detected by qPCR post vaccination for the duration of one four - week study [ 23 ] . Shedding of field CPV strains in dogs has been detected by qPCR for 45 - 50 days [ 44 , 45 ] , while CPV vaccine virus was shed for 19 - 22 days on average [ 31 , 46 ] . Further studies are warranted in cats to further define the duration of faecal shedding of both field and vaccine strains of FPV detectable by qPCR .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
