When the cutoff value of BAL fluid total WBC count was $ 510 / mL , which was selected using Youden ' s Index , sensitivity was 83 . 3 % ( 95 % CI ; 67 . 9 - 93 . 2 ) , specificity was 78 . 3 % ( 95 % CI ; 62 . 2 - 88 . 6 ) , positive predictive value was 68 . 2 % ( 95 % CI ; 49 . 2 - 82 . 6 ) , negative predictive value was 89 . 3 % ( 95 % CI ; 77 . 0 - 95 . 5 ) , positive likelihood ratio was 3 . 83 ( 95 % CI ; 1 . 80 - 8 . 17 ) , and negative likelihood ratio was 0 . 21 ( 95 % CI ; 0 . 08 - 0 . 52 ) . A combination of BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $ 0 . 71 ng / mL had a sensitivity of 95 . 8 % ( 95 % CI ; 81 . 6 - 99 . 8 ) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0 . 07 ( 95 % CI ; 0 . 003 - 0 . 40 ) , whereas BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL and serum C - reactive protein concentration $ 26 . 1 mg / dl had specificity of 95 . 7 % ( 95 % CI , 81 . 6 - 99 . 8 ) and a positive likelihood ratio of 8 . 63 ( 95 % CI , 1 . 31 - 180 . 96 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
