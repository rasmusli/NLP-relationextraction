The lamps were directed at the 26 cm \u00d7 25 . 6 cm chamber window which was constructed of 254 - \u00b5m thick UV transparent plastic film ( Topas 8007x10 , Topas Advanced Polymers , Florence , KY ) , and which had a transmission of ~ 65 % at 222 nm . The wall of the irradiation chamber opposite the transparent window was constructed with polished aluminum in order to reflect a portion of the UVC light back through the exposure region , therefore increasing the overall exposure dose by having photo pass in both directions . The depth of the irradiation chamber between the window and the aluminum panel was 6 . 3 cm , creating a total exposure volume of 4 . 2 L . Flow of the aerosols continues out of the irradiation chamber to a set of three way valves that could be configured to either pass through a bypass channel ( used when no sampling was required ) , or a BioSampler ( SKC Inc , Eighty Four , PA ) used to collect the virus . The BioSampler uses sonic flow impingement upon a liquid surface to collect aerosols when operated at an air flow of 12 . 5 L / min . Finally , flow continued out of the system through a final HEPA filter and to a vacuum pump ( WP6111560 , EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . The vacuum pump at the end of the system powered flow through the irradiation chamber . The flow rate through the system was governed by the BioSampler . Given the flow rate and the total exposure volume of the irradiation chamber , 4 . 2 L , a single aerosol droplet passed through the exposure volume in approximately 20 seconds .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 448}, "obj": "ne"}]}
