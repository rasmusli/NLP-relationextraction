These consensus - level variations across the samples occurred in all five genes of the rabies genome as well as four intergenic regions ( Fig . S2 ) . The intergenic regions tended have higher rates of consensus - level mutations compared to the 5 genes , with the region between G and L being the most variable ( 0 . 06 mutations per nucleotide , Table 1 The intergenic region between G and L remained the most variable , followed by the intergenic region between P and M . The M protein had the highest rate of consensus - level variation across all samples , but the G protein had the highest rate of consensuslevel variation in the outbreak samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
