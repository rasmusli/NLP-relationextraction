Metagenomics detected no Bartonella DNA matching to gltA or rpoB in either saliva or fecal pools . This absence could be explained in that the short sequences ( 345 - 425 bp ) used as targets , and the large size of bacterial genomes together make the likelihood of detecting a specific gene low . However , the Bartonella - like reads and contigs recovered from saliva and feces were short fragments ( 51 - 258 bp ) and showed low homology to known Bartonella from GenBank ( S4 Table ) . Notably , we used a similar approach to search for other bacteria ( i . e . , hemoplasmas ) and found clear evidence of their presence [ 8 ] . While this could suggest true absence of Bartonella from bat saliva and feces , our PCR found Bartonella in a subset of individual saliva and fecal samples . This discrepancy between methods could stem from treating saliva and fecal pools with DNase before metagenomic sequencing . Furthermore , phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these sequences were closely related to those identified in blood , which argues against these PCR positives only representing bacteria derived from environmental contamination or from feeding on prey . PCR results further showed strong correspondence between blood and saliva , suggesting that Bartonella infection may be systemic in vampire bats . While fecal and blood PCR results also mostly matched , we found one case where a bat was negative in blood but positive in feces . As consumption of ectoparasites during grooming has been observed in other bat families ( e . g . , Pteropodidae [ 80 ] ) , this discrepancy could suggest the incidental ingestion of ectoparasites during grooming and that this does not lead to systemic infection more generally indicated by the concordance between blood , saliva , and fecal positives and their close genetic similarity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
