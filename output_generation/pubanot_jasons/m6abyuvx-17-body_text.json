To determine the functional reactivity of HCV - specific CD8 + T cells , we performed a CD107a mobilization assay and intracellular IFNc staining . CN2 - 29 transgenic mice expressed the HCV structural protein and the NS2 region . However , rVV - N25 comprised only Isolated splenocytes from immunized mice were co - cultured with EL - 4CN2 or EL - 4NS2 cell lines for 2 weeks and analyzed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
