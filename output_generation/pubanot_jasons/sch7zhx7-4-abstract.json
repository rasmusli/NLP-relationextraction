We isolated two distinct viral mutants in the 2A and 3C proteases . We determined that these mutant viruses were resistant to polyamine depletion and that these mutations conferred no fitness advantage in the absence of polyamine depletion . To investigate the proteolytic activity of these enzymes , we developed a protease - dependent split - luciferase reporter system to measure 2A and 3C activity . Using this assay , we observed that 2A and 3C activity was diminished with polyamine depletion , to which mutant 2A and 3C proteases were resistant . Additionally , we observed that viruses containing these mutants were able to cleave cellular targets efficiently in polyamine - depleted cells . Together , these data suggest that polyamines are crucial for viral protease activity and that we may target CVB3 proteolytic activity through polyamine - depleting pharmaceuticals like DFMO .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 30}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 133}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 281}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 375}, "obj": "ne"}]}
