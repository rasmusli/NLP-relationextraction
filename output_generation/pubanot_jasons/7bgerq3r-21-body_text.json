The low rate of asymptomatic infection in Korea is attributable to the different transmission pathway of MERS infections compared to the Middle East . In Korea , most of the MERS cases were healthcare - associated infections , and none were from an animal . The low asymptomatic infection rate is also attributable to the extensive epid investigation conducted in Korea , including close monitoring of contacts with MERS patients ; this helped identify almost all MERS patients . This may also have been attributable to the promotion of proactive identification of patients via mass media and the establishment of communication networks by the government , leading to voluntary reports by people , active quarantine , and countermeasures to this public health crisis [ 10 , 28 , 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
