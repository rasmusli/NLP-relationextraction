The length of the F - M2 intergenic region was different between group A and B viruses , that is , 13 nt and 2 nt , respectively . The SH - G and G - L intergenic regions were the longest , up to 125 nt and to 190 nt , respectively . Consensus nucleotides ( 9 to 19 length ) at the putative start and end regions flanking the ORF of the viral genes are shown in Fig . 1 . The gene - start and - end regions of N and P were conserved ( > 90 % average pairwise identity ) in both HMPV groups , and the M2 and M gene - start and - end were also conserved in HMPV group A and B , respectively . The putative ATG start codon was consistently located at positions 14 - 16 upstream of a gene start motif ( consensus : GG / AGAC / TAAA / GTnnnnATG ) , except for the internal M2 - 2 . An additional ATG start codon upstream of the gene - start motif was observed in the SH gene for the B1 and B2 strains . In five of the eight annotated genes ( N , P , F , M2 , and G ( B1 and B2 strains only ) ) , the intergenic regions were short and the ORFs for these 5 genes terminated within the propositioned gene - end motifs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
