After specifying a model for { R k , t } , we have a regression model with time series errors , that can be fit using standard maximum likelihood methods . We selected the order of the SARIMA model for the time series errors , { X k , t } , as defined by ( 4 ) in the Appendix using standard identification techniques based on the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation ( e . g . , [ 18 ] ) . To facilitate the comparison of the time series models across cities , we restricted to same order of model for each series . The orders p k = 1 and q k = 1 , correspond to a single autoregressive and moving average term on the daily scale , equivalent to observing an autoregressive process of first order with measurement error ( [ 19 ] , Exercise 2 . 9 ) . With a seasonal period of seven days ( s = 7 ) , we set P k = 1 and Q k = 1 , so that the random seasonal component is a combination of an autoregressive and moving average term , each of first order over a period of seven days . The seasonal component of the time series model corresponds to an evolution of a first order autoregressive process with a measurement error over the weeks .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
