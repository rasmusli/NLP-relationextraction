Indeed , both treatment groups that were fed with virus - infected honeybee pupae had consistently higher viral titers than the controls . Since symptomatic honeybees with an overt infection have 10 10 + genomic equivalents of DWV and at lower infection levels 10 3 - 10 9 genomic copies [ 67 ] , the titers observed in M . rubra seem to reflect covert infections . However , the average honeybee worker ( ~ 120 mg ) weights about 60 times more than a M . rubra worker [ 68 , 69 ] . When controlled for these bodyweight differences , the DWV A and B titers found in the treatment groups therefore almost reach infection levels per mg ant - tissue analogous to an overt infection in bees . Further , the viral titers were very low in the control colonies , thereby indicating that DWV A and B were only replicating in the treatments . Interestingly , the ratios of DWV type - B to type - A were very similar in the ants , regardless of the treatment ( 4 . 17 / 1 ( T1 ) , 5 . 46 / 1 ( T2 ) , as well as in the injected honeybee pupae ( 5 . 88 / 1 for DWV - B to DWV - A ) , thereby suggesting that both strains had similar reproductive capacities in both hosts .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 158}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 501}, "obj": "ne"}]}
