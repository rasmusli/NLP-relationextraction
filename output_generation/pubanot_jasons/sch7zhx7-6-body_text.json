For all infections , DFMO and diethylnorsmperidine ( DENSpm ) were maintained throughout infection as designated . Viral stocks were maintained at \u2212 80 \u2022 C . For infection , the virus was diluted in serum - free DMEM for a multiplicity of infection ( M ) of 0 . 1 on Vero cells , unless otherwise indicated . The viral inoculum was overlain on cells for 10 to 30 min , and the cells were washed with PBS before replenishment of media . Supernatants were collected from CVB3 24 hpi and 48 hpi . Dilutions of cell supernatant were prepared in serum - free DMEM and used to inoculate confluent monolayer of Vero cells for 10 to 15 min at 37 \u2022 C . Cells were overlaid with 0 . 8 % agarose in DMEM containing 2 % NBCS . CVB3 samples incubated for 2 days at 37 \u2022 C . Following appropriate incubation , cells were fixed with 4 % formalin and revealed with crystal violet solution ( 10 % crystal violet ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Plaques were enumerated and used to back - calculate the number of plaque forming units ( pfu ) per milliliter of collected volume .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 271}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 296}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 305}, "obj": "ne"}]}
