To avoid casualties from outbreaks of these infections and from the potential criminal uses of bioagents , surveillance systems are needed that have the capacity to identify such outbreaks accurately and rapidly . The accuracy and timeliness of biosurveillance systems rests on the ability to model the uncertainty , severity , and aberrancy of clinical symptoms that are likely to portend disease outbreaks as expressed through the data monitoring system . Shmueli [ 1 ] summarizes the problems that biosurveilla systems , in general , pose to traditional statistical monitoring : ( a ) biosurveillance data may not be independent or stationary ; ( b ) non - traditional data are assumed to contain earlier signature of an outbreak but this signal is weaker compared to actual diagnosis data ; ( c ) since there are no data that contain bioterrorist outbreaks , outbreak patterns particularly as they would manifest in non - traditional data streams are unknown ; ( d ) biosurveillance data are assumed to have no bioterrorist outbreaks , but the natural outbreaks add up to the background noise .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
