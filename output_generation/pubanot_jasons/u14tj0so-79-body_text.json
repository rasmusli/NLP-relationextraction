On the HK - PK and HK - PK - free data sets , accuracy of Iterative HFold is not significantly different on each of these . An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable base pairs , as calculated using the partition function [ 43 ] . Even better may be to calculate base pair proba for base pairs of pseudoknotted RNA structures ; however this requires ( n 5 ) time . Since HFold finds minimum free energy structure in O ( n 3 ) time , conditional on the given input structure , we are currently investigating ways to develop an O ( n 3 ) - time partition function version of HFold that can produce pseudoknotted base pair probabilities that are conditional on the given input structure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
