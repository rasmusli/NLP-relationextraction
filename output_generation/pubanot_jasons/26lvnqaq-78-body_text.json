This feature might be a strain - specific characteristic , depending on either the ability to spread systemically , the cleavability of the HA by unknown oviduct - specific enzymes [ 42 ] , or the HA receptor binding preference that determines the attachment of the virus to the epithelia . Besides HPAI viruses , known to replicate in the reproductive tract of chickens [ 43 ] , LPAI viruses have been associated with oophor and salpingitis of gallinaceous poultry but mostly in turkey breeders [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] , while only few reports describe the colonization of the oviduct by non - H9 subtypes of LPAI viruses upon either natural or experimental infection [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
