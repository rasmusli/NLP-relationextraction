HEC1 - 1A or T84 cell monolayers were created on 0 . 4 mm polyethylene terephthalate membrane hanging transwell inserts ( Millipore ) . Cell viability was . 95 % at the time of plating . Electrical resistance across the membrane , which ranged from 400 - 450 mOhms / cm 2 at the start of the transcytosis assay , confirmed monolayer integrity . Resistance was re - measured after the transcytosis assay in more than 50 % of wells and ranged from 450 - 480 mOhms / cm 2 . HIV - 1 alone or with antibody was added to monolayers in media buffered to pH 6 . 0 or 7 . 4 . After 12 hours , fluid in the lower chamber ( ' ' subnatant fluid ' ' ) , maintained at pH 7 . 4 , was collected and used to measure viral RNA copy number and infectivity . In the absence of cell monolayers , about 69 % of the virus inoculum was present in the lower chamber of the wells after 12 hours . FcRn knockdown of HEC - 1A cells HEC - 1A cells were transduced with FcRn shRNA Lentiviral Particles ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . ) following manufacturer ' s protocol . Cells were selected in medium containing 5 mg / ml Puromycin dihydrochloride ( Sigma - Aldrich Inc . ) , and FcRn expression was verified by flow cytometry using rabbit polyclonal anti - FcRn antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . ) , normal rabbit IgG ( negative control ) and FITC - goat anti - rabbit IgG F ( ab9 ) 2 secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc . ) ( Figure S3A ) . Cytofix / Cytoperm Plus Kits ( BD Biosciences ) were used to fix , permeabilize and stain cells . Knockdown of FcRn was also confirmed by western blot using rabbit anti - FcRn antibody ( Novus Biologicals ) ( Figure S3A ) . Wild - type and knockdown cells had similar viability . Neither wildtype nor knockdown HEC - 1A cells stained for FccRIIa or FccRIIIa ( not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 271}, "obj": "ne"}]}
