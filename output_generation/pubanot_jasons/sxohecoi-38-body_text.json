All subjects gave written consent in accordance with an IRB - approved protocol . CVL was collected from one 34 year - old uninfected women and from three infected women ( age 29 to 46 years ) with CD4 + lymphocyte counts of 458 / mm 3 , 181 / mm 3 and 498 / mm 3 and plasma viral loads of 14100 copies / ml , 824 copies / ml and 88 copies / ml , respectively . Viral loads were not measured in the CVL fluid specimens . Two of the women ( with the lower plasma viral loads ) were receiving anti - retroviral therapy . Briefly , CVL fluid was obtained by flushing the cervix and vagina with 5 ml sterile saline , and the wash was collected into tubes with protease inhibitors ( [ 73 ] ) . Seminal fluid was obtained from two uninfected men ( ages 25 and 40 years ) , and from three infected men ( age 43 to 53 years ) by masturbation ( 58 ) . CD4 counts in the infected men were 404 / mm 3 , 336 / mm 3 and 407 / mm 3 and plasma viral loads were , 100 copies / ml , 8092 copies / ml and 6750 copies / ml , respectively ; only one of these subjects ( with viral load of 11 copies / ml ) was receiving anti - retroviral therapy . Seminal fluid was assayed for HIV - 1 RNA by PCR , but none was detected . The cervicovaginal and seminal fluids were centrifuged and supernatant fluids aliquoted and frozen at 280uC until assayed . Total IgG was determined by ELISA [ 74 ] . IgG isolation was accomplished by incubating samples with Protein G - Sepharose ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences Corp . ) followed by elution of bound IgG according to manufacturer ' s instructions . The IgG preparations were concentrated and dialyzed against DPBS using Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units ( Millipore Corp . ) . The IgG preparations from the two uninfected men were pooled to obtain sufficient quantity for experiments ; all other IgG preparations were tested individually .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
