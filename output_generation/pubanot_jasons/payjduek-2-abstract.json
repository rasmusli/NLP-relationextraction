We report the unusual finding of BCG reactivation in an infant with laboratory - confirmed measles . Case presentation : A previously healthy 7 - month old infant presented initially with fever , cough and coryza , and subsequently developed Koplik ' s spots followed by a typical morbilliform skin rash . There was significant contact history with a household relative who had recently been diagnosed with measles . On examination , a 2 . 5 cm area of erythema and induration was seen at the previous BCG inoculation site , in addition to the widespread maculopapular rash . No other clinical features of KD were present . Measles virus was isolated from the throat swab and measles antibodies ( IgM ) were present in the serum . The patient recovered completely with oral vitamin A and supportive therapy , and had normal echocardiography examination on follow up . Conclusions : This case report highlights the rare finding of BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed measles infection , and suggests that this clinical manifestation may occasionally occur in children with infections or conditions other than KD .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 60}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 66}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 157}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 282}, "obj": "ne"}]}
