We searched publicly available primate genome sequences and identified orthologs of all 17 human PARP family members from a minimum of four hominoids , two Old World monkeys and one New World monkey . We performed a series of maximum likelihood analyses to detect recurrent positive selection for each PARP gene alignment . These analyses determine whether a model allowing positive selection at a subset of amino acid residues is a statistically better fit to the sequence data than a model that does not allow for positive selection . Using PAML software [ 40 ] , we found that five PARP genes showed highly statistically significant ( p - values , 0 . 0001 ) signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1B ) . In addition to confirming our earlier findings on PARP13 , we found that PARP4 ( also known as vPARP ) and the three macrodomain - containing PARP genes ( PARP9 / BAL1 , PARP14 / BAL2 and PARP15 / BAL3 ) all show signatures of positive selection . We followed up our PAML analyses with the more conservative PARRIS software implemented in the HyPhy package [ 41 ] , which takes into account recombination and variation in synonymous substitution rates across codons . Using PARRIS , we again found these five PARP genes to be clearly distinct from the remaining 12 as judged by likelihood ratio tests ( LRT ) allowing or disallowing positive selection ( Figure 1B ) . While our limited screen of seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p - value ( , 0 . 01 ) for PARP4 and PARP13 , analysis of additional sequences of PARP9 , PARP14 and PARP15 met statistical significance ( see below ) . Finally , we performed branch - site analyses [ 42 ] to look for episodic signatures of positive selection on all 17 primate PARPs . We found that only PARP4 , PARP9 and PARP13 demonstrated statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection ( Figure S1 ) . This initial screen might underestimate the total number of PARP genes evolving under positive selection , firstly because our search is restricted to the primate lineage ( selection might have operated only in other mammalian lineages ) and secondly because we use only seven orthologs . Although such small alignments may lack power to detect weak selection , previous simulation studies have shown that strong selection on a subset of residues can be detected using 1 PARPs are categorized as either poly - ADP - ribosyltransferases ( Poly - ) , mono - ADP - ribosyltransferases ( Mono - ) or inactive based on presence of conserved motifs and , when available , data using enzymatic assays [ 4 , 6 ] . 2 PARP9 and PARP13 lack one or more catalytic residues conserved in all other PARPs and are therefore predicted to lack catalytic activity , although it is unknown whether they still bind ADP - ribose or ADP - ribosylated proteins [ 4 ] . ( B ) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection . The five PARP genes showing strong signatures of positive selection are shown in red . Shown at left are values derived from PAML indicating twice the log difference between an evolutionary model that allows positive selection ( M8 ) versus a model that disallows position selection ( M8a ) . P - values indicate whether the model that allows positive selection better fits the data . PARRIS - derived LRT ( likelihood ratio test ) values also report the difference between the log - likelihood values for a model allowing positive selection versus a model that does not . Using seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p - value ( , 0 . 01 ) for PARP4 and PARP13 , however analysis of additional sequences of PARP9 , 14 and 15 found that these genes also met statistical significance ( see Results ) . Additional analyses are reported in Figure S1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1004403 . g001 PAML even with rather limited species surveys [ 43 ] . Given the signatures of positive selection we observed for PARP4 , 9 , 14 and 15 in this initial screen , we characterized these four genes in further detail , collecting additional orthologous sequences to examine which domains contain positively selected residues in order to create a model for how viral conflict may have driven their evolution .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
