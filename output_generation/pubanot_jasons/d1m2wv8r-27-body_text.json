Interestingly , a pathway that involved the degradation of CFTR was significantly enriched in our study . CFTR is a transmembrane protein that functions as an ATP - gated chloride channel 53 . Deficiency in CFTR can lead to several diseases related to the reduction of chloride secretion and the increase of sodium uptake 54 . Many studies have suggested that wound healing function is impaired in CFTR - deficient epithelial cells and that CFTR may be effective in cell repair after injury 18 , 55 , 56 . CPV is normally cytopathic in infected F81 cells . Typical CPEs appear as a mesh of monolayer cells prompted by detached cells . These results provided us hints that CPV may trigger CFTR deficiency and influence the cell pathological change by reducing the wound healing of infected cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 261}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 367, "end": 376}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 413}, "obj": "ne"}]}
