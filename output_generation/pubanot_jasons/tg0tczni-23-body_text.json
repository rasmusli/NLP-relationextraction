The overall codon usage among 48 ORFs of polioviruses was analyzed in this study . First , the ENC values of all the poliovirus samples were analyzed , and the results showed that the majority of polioviruses do not have a strong codon bias ( mean ENC = 53 . 754 > 40 ) . In addition , together with published data on codon usage bias among some RNA viruses , such as BVDV , H5N1 Table 4 Correlation analysis between the A , U , C , G contents and A 3 , U 3 , C 3 , G 3 influenza virus and SARS - covs with mean values of 51 . 43 , 50 . 91 and 48 . 99 , respectively , one possible explanation for this is that the weak codon bias of RNA virus is advantageous to replicate efficiently in vertebrate host cells , with potentially distinct codon preferences [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] . Natural selection and mutation pressure are thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] . In this study , the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure , rather than natural selection is the mainly factors on codon usage pattern of polioviruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
