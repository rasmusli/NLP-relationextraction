A viral stock was produced by inoculating 9 - to - 11 - day - old embryonated specific pathogen free ( SPF ) hen ' s eggs , via the allantoic cavity and was subsequently titrated according to the Reed and Muench method [ 24 ] , to determine the embryo infectious dose 50 % ( EID 50 ) . The stock was screened to exclude the presence of bacterial agents and common viruses of poultry as previously described [ 25 ] . The low pathogenicity of the virus had already been confirmed in a previous experimental study by calculating the intravenous pathogenicity index [ 26 ] that resulted to be 0 . The nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was made available in the GenBank database under the Accession Number JQ973659 by Davidson et al . [ 23 ] . The virus stock used in this studies had a history of three passages in embryonated chicken eggs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
