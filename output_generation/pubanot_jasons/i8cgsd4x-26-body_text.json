Our results suggest that proteasomal pathway ( and CxCullin4 ) does not play any role in WNV entry in mosquito cells ( S5 Fig ) . This is different than previously reported mechanism in mammalian cells [ 25 ] . This may be due to different mechanisms of viral entry in mammalian cells versus mosquito cells . It is also interesting that a number of reads from our data did not map to the published Culex quinquefasciatus transcriptome . Many of these transcripts may be expressed from unannotated genes which contribute to novel host - pathogen interactions in invertebrates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
