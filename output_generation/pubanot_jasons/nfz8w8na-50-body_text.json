During the SARS outbreak , some of the published literature questioned the evidence on the efficacy of the proposed interventions , quarantine ( Jacobs 2007 ) and travel advisories ( Paquin 2007 ) . In Brazil , some evidence suggests that the spike in microcephaly cases is not a consequence of the Zika virus , but rather , the result of conditions of poverty , including poor sanitation and exposure to la and insecticides ( Diniz 2016 ) . This calls into question recommendations to delay pregnancy due to the Zika virus . As discussed above , the quality of response from global health organizations to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia remains debatable and questions the evidence used to inform and justify these responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
