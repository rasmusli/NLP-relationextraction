However , the mechanisms employed by the virus to cross genital tract tissue and establish infection are uncertain . Since cervicovaginal fluid is acidic and HIV - 1 in cervicovaginal fluid is likely coated with antibodies , we explored the effect of low pH and HIV - 1 - specific antibodies on transcytosis , the movement of HIV - 1 across tight - junctioned epithelial cells . We found that the combination of HIV - 1 - specific antibodies and low pH enhanced transcytosis as much as 20 - fold . Virus that underwent trans under these conditions was infectious , and infectivity was highly influenced by whether or not the antibody neutralized the virus . We observed enhanced transcytosis using antibody from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids and using transmitted / founder strains of HIV - 1 . We also found that the enhanced transcytosis was due to the Fc neonatal receptor ( FcRn ) , which binds immune complexes at acidic pH and releases them at neutral pH . Finally , staining of human tissue revealed abundant FcRn expression on columnar epithelial cells of penile urethra and endocervix . Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein HIV - 1 may facilitate its own transmission by usurping the antibody response directed against itself . These results have important implications for HIV vaccine development and for understanding the earliest events in HIV transmission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
