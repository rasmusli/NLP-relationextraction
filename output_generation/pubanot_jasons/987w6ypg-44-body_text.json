Briefly , selfinactivating ( SIN ) lentivectors were produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells using a viral genome bearing a miR30 - shRNAs - Puromycin cassette ( a mixture of two target sequences per gene was used ) . Virions were then purified and normalized by exo - RT , so that an identical viral input was used to challenge target cells with control or with the overall pool of IFITM1 , 2 , 3 specific miR30 - shRNAs . The silencing procedure was then adapted experimentally for each cell type to reach the best possible compromise between high silencing efficiency and optimal cell survival . In the case of HeLaP4 cells , after a short Puromycin selection ( 4 days ) , cells were seeded and used as virus producing cells . To this end , cells were challenged with an MOI of 1 of replication competent HIV - 1 ( NL4 - 3 ) to obtain a substantial fraction of virus - producing cells . After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment to remove non - internalized virus , cells were seeded and newly produced viruses were harvested 2 to 3 days afterwards from the supernatant of knockdown cells . Virions were normalized by exo - RT and used to challenge na\u00efve HeLaP4 cells . The amount of infectious viral particles present in the different preparations was then assessed 24 hours later following a MAGI assay on these cells . For silencing experiments in primary macrophages , cells were similarly transduced in the presence of virion - like particles containing Vpx ( VLPs - Vpx provided at an MOIequivalent of 0 , 5 ) that increase the overall transduction efficiency of lentiviruses in human myeloid cells by removing a restriction at reverse transcription , according to a well - established protocol [ 39 ] . In this case , silenced cells were used in the absence of Puromycin selection and were challenged with an MOI of 1 of the R5 tropic replicationcompetent ADA . After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment , virions were harvested 4 to 6 days afterwards and similarly normalized by exo - RT prior to challenge of HeLaP5 cells ( expressing the CCR5 co - receptor ) and MAGI assay . In the case of Jurkat cells , silenced cells were kept in Puromycin selection and used in replicative infections using the NL4 - 3 virus . Aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested at different time points and the extent of viral spread was assessed by exo - RT activity . To determine the intrinsic infectivity of viral particles produced in Jurkat cells treated as mentioned in the text , viral particles were retrieved at day 9 post infection to obtain sufficient amount of virus for our analysis , then viral preparations were normalized by exo - RT activity and used to challenge na\u00efve HeLaP4 reporter cells . The infectivity of normalized viral particles was then determined by a MAGI assay 24 hours later .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 287}, "obj": "ne"}]}
