Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers into consideration is necessary . A better understanding and estimation of the behavior characteristics of the index patient is also important for infection risk assessment and control in airplane cabin . To reduce the pathogen concentration in the high - dose region close to the index patient , a personal ventilation system may be a feasible solution which is still needed to be carefully designed and verified in airplane cabin operation . Using N95 respirator masks of the index patient or the passengers can also be a simple and viable method to prevent exposure from inhalation the expiratory aerosols . In future studies , investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
