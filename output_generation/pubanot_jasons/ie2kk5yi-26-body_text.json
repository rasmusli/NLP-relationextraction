The saliva pool from Amazonas had no matching Bartonella - like reads or contigs ( S4 Table ) , while one read each from the Loreto and Cajamarca saliva pool was assigned as Bartonella by nucleotide BLAST ; however , these reported species assignments should be Table ) . Bartonella sequences from this study are displayed with genotype , bat ID numbers , and accession numbers . Sequences from GenBank are colored by host taxa and provided with accession numbers , species , and sampling location . Diamonds depict posterior probabilities of nodes greater than 50 % . interpreted cautiously as they are based on one read and percent identity was low . Pooled fecal samples from all departments of Peru contained Bartonella - like reads and contigs . Bartonella ancashensis , B . australis , and B . bacilliformis were all identified at both the read and contig level in fecal samples . However , because percent identity was relatively low , species assignments should again be interpreted cautiously . Subsequent BLAST hits following the top hit also frequently ( though not always ) matched to Bartonella , suggesting the presence of poorly characterized Bartonella species present or that these may be matches to other bacteria .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
