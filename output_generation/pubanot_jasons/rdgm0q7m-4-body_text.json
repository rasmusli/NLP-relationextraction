How these RNA structures act is incompletely understood , but accumulating evidence supports the view that by presenting an unusual topology ( 1 , 2 , ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) they confound an intrinsic unwinding activity of the ribosome with consequent effects on the elongation cycle and frame maintenance ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 ) . Indeed , kinetic analyses in bacterial systems indicate that stimulatory RNAs can impair movements of the ribosomal small subunit ( 30S ) head , delaying dissociation of EF - G and the release of tRNA from the ribosome ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
