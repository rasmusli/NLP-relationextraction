Along with the emergence of newly - recognized human pathogens ( the SARS coronavirus , the recent influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 ) , the ever - increasing incidence of chronic viral infections caused by HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses continues to increase OPEN ACCESS the global burden of infectious diseases [ 1 , 2 ] . Vaccines have been developed for some of the most important viral pathogens . Although vaccines against HIV [ 3 ] and hepatitis C virus [ 4 ] are in clinical phases III and II respectively , there is still little prospect of effective vaccines against these agents . There are enormous challenges to the development of these vaccines , especially since millions of people are already chronically infected with these viruses , which would require therapeutic vaccines for control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
