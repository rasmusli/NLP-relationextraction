Here , we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide . Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global influenza spread , an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies ( e . g . [ 5 ] ) , but has , until now , remained difficult to obtain from empirical data . The dominant predictors of influenza spread will undoubtedly be scale - dependent , as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas ( Fig . 2 ) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel , such as workplace commuting [ 9 ] . This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales , where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious , provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available . One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of H3N2 sequences worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location , which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes . More representative sampling across the globe , or within a more geographically confined area of interest , will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures . In particular , if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [ 34 ] . In addition , many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution , for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin - destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
