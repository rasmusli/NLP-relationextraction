In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes . We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71 . 3 and 80 % for HMPV group A and B , respectively , the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes , and multiple subgroups co - circulated in various countries . Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length ( 219 to 241 amino acids ) due to changes in the stop codon position . Genome - wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
