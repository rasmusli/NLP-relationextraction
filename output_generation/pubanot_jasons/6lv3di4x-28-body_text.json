NEC were apically challenged with an MOI of 0 . 1 TCID 50 / cell for 1 . 5 h at 37 \u00b0 C . Then the virus inoculum was discarded , the NEC apical surface washed three times with prewarmed PBS [UNK] / [UNK] , and the inserts were transferred into new plates with fresh ALI medium in the basolateral chamber for culture at 37 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 . Mock infection controls were included . After 24 , 48 , and 72 hpi , apical washes and basolateral medium were collected and stored at \u03ea70 \u00b0 C for later titrations . RNA was extracted from NEC at each indicated time postinfection . An extra insert was kept for 72 hpi to fix in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for immunolabeling .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
