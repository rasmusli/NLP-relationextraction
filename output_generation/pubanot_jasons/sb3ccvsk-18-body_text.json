Nevertheless , a firm association between virus and MS remains elusive , as active viral replication has thus far never been detected within CNS tissue of MS patients . On the other side , a protective role of viral infections against autoimmune diseases has also been proposed ( 8 ) , but the mechanisms preventing autoimmunity after viral infections remain largely unknown . Among MS murine models , JHMV infection reproduces several aspects of MS pathogenesis ( 12 ) . Important , tissue damage occurs temporally remote from viral infection as indicated by peak demyelination after elimination of infectious virus ( 12 ) . Moreover , lesion size is constrained by IL - 10 during persistence independent of viral load ( 42 ) . Lastly , myelin loss correlates with the peripheral activation of myelin - specific CD4 + T cells , which access the CNS but decline with time despite ongoing demyelination ( 13 ) . The apparent control of the endogenous SR T cells suggested suppressive mechanisms prevent ascending clinical autoimmune disease during persistent infection . JHMV infection thus represents a unique model to assess how viral infection may prevent autoimmunity . As Foxp3 + Tregs are among the regulatory mechanisms dampening JHMV pathogenesis , their implication in controlling SR CD4 + T cells was of particular interest . The data herein are novel in demonstrating that Foxp3 + Treg abrogation during persistence preferentially enhanced endogenously primed , peripheral SR CD4 + T cells but had no effect on CNS localized SR T cells or tissue damage during chronic JHMV infection . These observations are consistent with a previous report by Trandem et al . ( 20 ) showing that naive Foxp3 + Tregs adoptively transferred into acutely JHMV - infected mice were not detected within the CNS but rather exerted prominent function within CLN by dampening dendritic cell activation , T cell proliferation , and pro - inflammatory cytokine expression . Foxp3 + Treg dependent downregulation of CLN inflammatory response thus correlated with limited CNS inflammation and demyelination without affecting viral persistence ( 20 ) . Our results on regulation of SR T cells during persistence also corroborated control of transferred SR CD4 + T cell proliferation by Foxp3 + Tregs during a heterologous MHV infection ( 21 ) . A primary role of Foxp3 + Tregs within draining lymph nodes was also observed in other infectious models , as well as during cancer and autoimmunity ( 36 , ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 ) . Nevertheless , our data differ from results by Trandem et al . with respect to the direct correlation between decreased peripheral inflammation by Foxp3 + Tregs with decreased CNS cellular infiltration and demyelination . Despite extensive expansion of the inflammatory response within the CLN of mice depleted of Foxp3 + Tregs during persistence , no alteration of CNS inflammation or tissue damage was evident . These differences may reside in the differential properties of the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) between acute and chronic JHMV infection , as BBB permeability is restored to naive levels after day 14 p . i . ( 46 ) , thus potentially limiting effector T cell access into the CNS after Foxp3 + Treg depletion . Further , enlarged CLN associated with increased chemokine expression indicated restricted T cell egress is responsible for the lack of altered CNS inflammation . Retention of effector T cells within the draining lymph nodes following Foxp3 + Treg depletion was also observed during herpes simplex viral ( HSV ) infection . In this model , Treg - mediated suppression of chemokine production within lymph nodes facilitated effector T cell egress and trafficking to the infection site ( 36 ) . While a similar mode of Treg action is supported by our studies , Treg supplementation , rather than depletion , enhanced chemokine production and T effector cell retention in lymph nodes during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , thereby diminishing CNS T cell migration ( 47 ) . All together , these diverse CNS inflammation models suggest that Foxp3 + Treg can modulate effector T cells in draining lymph nodes both at the expansion phase as well as egress phase . The relative balance between expansion and local cytokine / chemokine expression then ultimately determines egress into circulation and access to the CNS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
