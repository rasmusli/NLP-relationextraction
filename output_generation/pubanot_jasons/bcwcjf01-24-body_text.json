Nonsense mutations generate defective RNAs that may or may not be functional . Stop codon mutations were shown to be maintained within the dengue virus populations , leading to altered viral fitness and thus influencing transmission dynamics [ 23 ] . Likewise , it has been shown that human respiratory syncytial virus mutants lacking the G gene are still able to form infectious particles in vitro [ 24 ] . Across all samples and genome locations sequenced by Illumina , 5146 variants were detected at 2302 genomic locations , or 22 % of the 10451 positions sequenced . The frequency of these variants range from extremely rare ( 0 . 02 % at Fx5 genome location 2130 , high detection sensitivity due to high coverage of . 196 , 0006 , see Figure S1 ) to very common ( 38 % at Fx 40 genome location 1021 , measured at 32 % by 454 ) . The mean frequency of the variant pool is 0 . 3 % , indicating that the bulk of the variants detected are ultra rare . To examine where in the genome mutations are most likely to occur , only those mutations that occur at . 1 % in a sample or occur in multiple samples with a cumulative frequency . 1 % are retained for further analysis . There are 248 loci with such high occurrence / frequency variants ( ' ' one - percent variants ' ' , Figure S9 ) , their distribution across the coding and non - coding regions of the rabies genome ( Figure S10 ) are very similar to that of the 243 mutations occurring at the consensus level ( Figure S2 ) . In fact , 58 of these one - percent variants occur at loci with consensus - level mutations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
