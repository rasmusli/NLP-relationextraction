Dermal abnormalities include nodules , ulcerations or more rarely exfoliative dermatitis . They are generalized or localized , symmetrical or asymmetric and may , though less frequently , appear all over the body in a focal , multifocal , regional or diffuse pattern [ 12 - 14 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 62 , 64 , 68 , 70 ] . Some cats may harbour different types of skin lesions at the same time or develop them subsequently ; they may coexist with mucocutaneous lesions ( Fig . 3 ) . Cutaneous and mucocutaneous nodules , of variable size , are more often localized on the head , including eyelids , nose and lips , or on the distal parts of the limbs . Nodules have Ulcerations which may be diffuse and superficial or focal and deep ( Fig . 4 ) are localized on the same body sites as nodules , and may be complicated by bacterial infections that explain why they are covered by hemorrhagic crusts and / or purulent material [ 13 , 14 , 52 , 53 , 56 , 58 , 60 - 62 , 64 , 65 , 68 , 70 ] . However , ulcerative dermatitis is sometimes diffuse and can be observed on the body trunk or on bony prominences [ 14 , 36 , 58 , 62 , 63 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
