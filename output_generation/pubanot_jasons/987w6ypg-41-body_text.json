After Formalin fixation , cells were incubated with the following antibodies : anti - Flag ( F742 , Sigma ) , followed by DyLight 649 - conjugated sheep , or FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( STAR36D649 AbD serotec and FI - 1000 Vector ) . DAPI - containing mounting medium was finally used ( DAPI Fluormount G , Southern biotech ) . Images were acquired using a spectral Leica sp5 and analyzed with the Fiji software [ 54 ] . Two - dimensional graphs representing pixel intensities ( gray level ) were plotted along a 30\u03bcm lines ( yellow on Figure 3B ) , using Plot Profile tool in Image - J . The extent of reciprocal co - localization between Gag and IFITMs was quantified using the Manders overlap coefficient ( Fuji image software ) on more than 40 cells per condition .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 55}, "obj": "ne"}]}
