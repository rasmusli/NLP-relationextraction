The role of these cell penetrating motifs during infection has yet to be elucidated but it is interesting to see that another obligate intracellular pathogen , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , also possesses a cell wall protein with such a peptide sequence [ 25 ] . CPPs represent an example of how understanding how pathogens interact with human host cells can lead to new ways to treat and prevent viral infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
