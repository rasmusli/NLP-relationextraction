Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( Ingenuity Systems , www . ingenuity . com ) performed on all differentially regulated genes indicated that various pathways and cellular processes were involved during infection , including the immune signalling , the cell - cycle / apoptosis and proteasomal pathways , metabolism genes and the cell transport machinery ( Fig 1A ) . Transcripts , which could not be functionally annotated were grouped as other or unknown . Genes in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway comprised 12 % of differentially regulated transcripts and were selected for further analysis . To validate the RNA - Seq analysis , the relative abundance of seven differentially up - regulated transcripts in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway was determined by real - time RT - qPCR using target - specific primers . The results confirmed that all of the transcripts were up - regulated during infection but the fold - increase was consistently overestimated by RNA - Seq analysis ( Fig 1B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
