The clinical symptoms included respiratory disease which was mild in nature and could be diagnosed with radio imaging and computed tomography [ 54 , 56 , 59 ] and respiratory disease of severe nature showing fatal clinical symptoms requiring euthanasia [ 54 , 59 ] . Exposure to the MERS - 0 infectious clone ( icMERS - 0 ) strain in R monkeys is reported to cause respiratory disease , wherein virus antigen has been detected . Respiratory disease in such cases was found to be transient and mild in nature , which resolved by 30 days from infection . Pulmonary disease was also found to be mild upon MERS - CoV infection in NHPs . Earlier studies found ocular , intratracheal or intranasal exposure of MERS - EMC isolate to cause lethal disease . However , it has been argued that lethality was due to manipulations of marmoset , which have higher sensitivity than macaque species [ 54 , 57 ] . Cases of mild to moderate symptoms even after higher viral titer have also been reported in other studies [ 56 ] . Small animals , such as hamsters and mice , have been found to be resistant to MERS - CoV infection and development of models of severe respiratory disease has been a challenge [ 60 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
