This signal operates during translation of the genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) , a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales ( 20 ) . The PRRSV genome ( Figure 1 ) , a positive - sense RNA molecule some 15 kb in length , harbours two PRF signals . A ' canonical ' \u2212 1 PRF element , including a stimulatory RNA pseudo - The \u223c 15 - kb PRRSV genome has two long 5 ORFs , 1a and 1b encoding non - structural polyproteins ( nsps ) and at least eight shorter 3 ORFs ( 2a - 7 ) encoding structural proteins . ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA , with translation of ORF1b depending on \u2212 1 PRF at the end of ORF1a . The TF ORF overlaps the central ORF1a region in the \u2212 2 reading frame and is accessed via \u2212 2 PRF ( 18 ) . A \u2212 1 frameshift at the same site generates the nsp2N product . Shown below is the sequence of the SD01 - 08 RNA in the region of the \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF signal , with the slippery sequence ( purple ) and C - rich motif ( red ) highlighted . The \u2212 1 reading frame stop codon is underlined and codons for each of the reading frames are indicated . ( B ) Crystal structure of the PRRSV nsp1 \u2424 dimer ( 32 ) . The putative RNA binding domain is in orange ( see text ) . ( C ) RNAs derived from FspI - cut pDluc PRRSV / wt , or a variant with the \u2212 1 frame stop codon ( panel A ) changed to UUA ( PRRSV / stop ) , were translated in RRL in the presence of the indicated concentrations of His - tagged nsp1 \u2424 ( M ) or with nsp1 \u2424 dilution buffer ( DB ) . The products were resolved by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and visualized by autoradiography . 14 C molecular size markers were also run on the gel ( M ) . Products generated by ribosomes that do not frameshift ( stop ) or that enter the \u2212 1 or \u2212 2 frames are indicated . The asterisk indicates the \u2212 1 PRF product of the PRRSV / wt construct . ( D ) In vitro translation of pDluc PRRSV / wt mRNA in the presence of 1 M GST - nsp1 \u2424 or mutant derivatives ( PR , RBM ; see text ) . Control translations were supplemented with an equivalent concentration of expressed GST or DB alone . Translation products were analysed and quantified as above ( C ) . knot structure , is located at the junction of the overlapping replicase - encoding ORFs 1a and 1b and facilitates expression of an ORF1a - ORF1b fusion product . The second signal , which stimulates both \u2212 2 PRF and \u2212 1 PRF , is located within the region of ORF1a that encodes a large , multifunctional replicase subunit , non - structural protein 2 ( nsp2 ) . Here , about 20 % of ribosomes translating nsp2 frameshift into the \u2212 2 reading frame to generate a transframe fusion protein ( nsp2TF ) comprising the N - terminal two - thirds of nsp2 and a C - terminus derived from a conserved , overlap - ping ORF ( transframe ; TF ) in the \u2212 2 reading frame . A further 7 % of ribosomes shift into the \u2212 1 reading frame where they immediately encounter a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a truncated version of nsp2 termed nsp2N ( 19 ) . As shown in Figure 1A , the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence ( GG GUU UUU ) used for \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF in PRRSV does not harbour an obvious secondary structure compatible with canonical RNA - structure - stimulated PRF . However , mutations within a conserved CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nt downstream of the shift site reduce or Nucleic Acids Research , 2016 , Vol . 44 , No . 12 5493 inhibit frameshifting , consistent with the presence of a 3 stimulatory element of some form ( 18 ) . A further novelty of the PRRSV \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF signal is an essential role for the 25 - kDa viral replicase subunit nsp1 \u2424 , which functions as a trans - activator of both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF ( Figure 1B ) ( 19 ) . Nsp1 \u2424 is one of the 14 subunits produced from the PRRSV replicase polyproteins . How it acts in PRF is unclear but replacement of basic residues within a highly conserved putative RNA - binding motif located in the papain - like autoproteinase ( PLP ) domain of nsp1 \u2424 have a detrimental effect on frameshifting ( 19 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
