Age plays a major role in pneumonia risk . In developed countries , such as the USA , the risk of pneumonia is highest in individuals who are 65 years or over ( Fig . 1 ) [ 48 ] . The elevated risk in the elderly is likely due to impaired host defenses and an increase in comorbidities - heart failure , liver disease and underlying lung diseasewhich increase risk of aspiration pneumonia that can occur from dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( reviewed by Akg\u00fcn et al . [ 49 ] ) . In developing countries , the burden of pneumonia is greatest in young children [ 2 ] due to their inability to physically remove and immunologically deal with bacterial pathogens ( reviewed by Siegrist [ 50 ] ) . Very young children also have the greatest prevalence in the nasopharynx of common bacterial pneumonia pathogens : S . pneumoniae , H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis [ 23 , 51 ] . Increased carriage may be an important risk factor for pneumonia if the URT bacterial community structure is a determinant of pneumonia etiology . Unfortunately , the majority of carriage studies have been conducted among children < 5 years of age , which limits our ability to establish the role of nasopharyngeal carriage in other age groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
