Direct methods are based on studying the effect of a tested product ( e . g . food ) containing antioxidants on the oxidative degradation of a testing system . The substrate of oxidation may be individual lipids , lipid mixtures ( oils ) , proteins , DNA , blood plasma , LDL , and biological membranes . Homogenous lipids or microheterogeneous systems ( micelles and liposomes ) can be used depending on the solubility of samples . The indirect method studies the ability of antioxidant to scavenge some free radicals , which is not associated with the real oxidative degradation [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
