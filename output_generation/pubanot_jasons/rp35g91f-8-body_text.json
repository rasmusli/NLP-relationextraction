( 2011 ) . Genome - wide association analyses were performed using gene expression microarray values measured on a log 2 scale . Correlation analysis was performed with Pearson ' s correlation , and outliers were removed . For interval mapping , likelihood ratio statistic ( LRS ) scores were plotted on the y - axis vs . chromosomal location on the x - axis ( autosomes and X chromosome ) . An LRS score . 17 was significant and an LRS score . 10 was suggestive at a genome - wide P value of , 0 . 05 using 5000 permutations . LRS scores were computed using Haley - Knott regression ( Haley and Knott 1992 ) . The genomic intervals analyzed were selected based on the location at which the eQTL peak crossed the suggested or significant LRS threshold . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was used to merge multiple gene expression traits into a single , synthetic trait that represented a cellspecific gene expression signature .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
