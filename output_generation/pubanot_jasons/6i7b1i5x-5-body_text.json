However , there is a proposed relation to an infectious agent . Epidemiological evidence for this comes from the fact that there are seasonal peaks of KD during winter and spring months and outbreaks have been described [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] . Siblings have a higher rate of KD than the general population ; usually cases are within the first year [ 29 ] , and can be as high as up to 50 % of cases within 10 days of each other [ 30 ] . Recent studies show a lower incidence in breastfed infants [ 31 ] and KD is rare in both newborns and individuals over five years of age . This implies a maternally derived protective immunity to a ubiquitous infectious agent [ 32 ] . This phenomenon is similar to epidemiological findings with human herpesvirus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) infections . In fact , HHV - 6 is one of several potential etiologies that have been proposed as the cause of KD [ 11 , 16 ] . Other notable infectious agents include other Herpesviridae ( Epstein Barr virus , Cytomegalovirus ) , human coronavirus ( New Haven ) , retroviruses , Parvovirus B19 , bocavirus , and bacterial infections such as staphylococci , streptococci , Bartonella , and Yersinia infections . Some of these agents have been independently associated with aneurysm formation [ 15 ] . Epstein Barr virus particularly is associated with coronary aneurysms [ 33 ] . Several non - infectious agents have also been proposed such as carpet shampoos , mercury and living near bodies of water [ 11 , 16 ] . Additionally , the recent report of tropospheric wind patterns correlating with outbreaks in Japan would not be consistent with many of the viruses that have been proposed [ 21 , 34 , 35 ] . These reports imply a relationship to an environmental antigen , as either a priming or inciting event .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
