Until recently , resistance to colistin had only been associated with non - transferable genome mediated mutation . However , in 2015 , a stable plasmidmediated gene , mcr - 1 , encoding a phosphoethanolamine transferase conferring resistance to colistin was identified in certain GNB , such as E . coli and Salmonella , isolated from various origins including farm animals , raw meat and humans , in several countries [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . The discovery of a mechanism for horizontal transfer of colistin resistance , and hence the potential for interspecies transfers , gave rise to a strong reaction in the scientific community regarding the potential reduction of colistin effectiveness in human medicine [ 19 ] . Food producing animals , and in particular pigs , have been singled out as the most potential reservoirs for spread and amplification of colistin resistance [ 19 ] . Thus , scientists and regulatory agencies such as the European Medicine Agency ( EMA ) have recommended reducing the use of colistin in animal production and to restrict its use to the treatment of sick animals as a last resort option [ 20 ] . In addition , several studies have reported coexistence of the mcr - 1 gene with genes encoding the production of extended - spectrum \u03b2 - lactamase ( ESBL ) and carbapenemase enzymes [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . This constitutes an additional degree of concern about the risk of spread of resistance against antimicrobials of very high importance in human medicine . Furthermore , a high prevalence of ESBL - positive E . coli isolated from PWD piglets has been reported [ 24 ] . Taken together , these findings underline the need to better understand PWD risk factors and to find alternatives to antimicrobials and particularly to colistin in pigs for the control of PWD in order to manage antimicrobial resistance and maintain at the same time livestock productivity . Hence , the aim of the present review was to provide an overview of risk factors of PWD as well as an update of information on the extent of colistin use in PWD control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes . In addition , alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed . Finally , a practical approach is proposed for the control of the PWD in its various phases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 96}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 237}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 406}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 443, "end": 452}, "obj": "ne"}]}
