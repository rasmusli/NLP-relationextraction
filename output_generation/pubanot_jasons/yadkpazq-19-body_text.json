Due to the limited number of cats integrated in the study , we refrained from using a parametric approach in the statistical tests . As such tests require a larger sample size than n = 4 , it was not possible to calculate p - values for the induction in expression of each gene shown in Figure 2 . Differences between treatment groups in proliferation of PBMCs were analyzed with a Mann - Whitney test and expression of costimulatory molecules on the surface of these cells were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test , where values for each cat were paired . Relative Mx mRNA expression , OD values from viral inhibition assays , ratios for FeLV provirus and Ct values for FeLV viral RNA loads were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test with pairing of values for each cat when treatment with different supernatants were compared , or a Mann - Whitney test when incubation with supernatant was opposed to treatment with medium alone or rfeIFN\u03b1 . Normalized and relative TLR9 mRNA expression ratios between different animal age groups were also compared with a Mann - Whitney test . Longitudinal effects on FeLV viral and proviral loads were compared with each other using a Mann - Whitney test carried out with Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) values . Correlations were assessed using the Spearman test . p - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
