It has been shown previously that USP47 is specific for the cleavage of K48 - linked polyubiquitin chains and thus prevents the proteasomal degradation of substrates [ 88 ] . We could show that treatment with DI targeting USP47 leads to an enhanced polyubiquitination and entry of Gag into the MHC - I pathway , indicating that USP47 somehow interacts with Gag and prevents its entry into the UPS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 15}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 28}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 129}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 474}, "obj": "ne"}]}
