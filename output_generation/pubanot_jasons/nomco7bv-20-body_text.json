The uniformity of the results with respect to these outcomes also suggests that in the field of airway infection morbidity , studies may be comparable despite the fact that they often concentrate on different RTI outcomes . In line with the majority of epidemiological studies in this area of research , our study suffers from some limitations , including the reliance on self - reported outcomes and exposure data with the risk of misclassification . However , we found - for instance - a good agreement between BMI derived from self - reported weight and height data and BMI calculated from measured values available for a sub - cohort ( n = 508 ) . Moreover , differential misclassification which would substantially bias the relationship between obesity and RTIs is rather unexpected in this setting . The disproportional selection of women into the study may negatively impact the generalizability of some of our results .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
