For instance , HMPV - associated hospitalization was estimated at 6 . 5 per 1000 person years in infants in Soweto , South Africa [ 4 ] ; at 4 % in hospitalized children with severe ARI during a 2 - year period in Cameroon [ 5 ] ; and in rural western Kenya , incidence of HMPV associated with ARI cases in outpatient clinic visits was estimated at 0 . 43 per 100 person - years among outpatients [ 6 ] . In Kilifi coastal Kenya , between January 2007 to December 2011 , children under 6 months of age accounted for 44 % of HMPV positive cases , while 74 % were children under 1 year , and 1 . 3 % ( 2 / 160 ) were children > 36 months [ 7 ] . In Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps in Kenya , HMPV was detected in 5 . 7 % hospitalizations , and virus - positive crude hospitalization rate ( per 1000 children < 5 years old ) was 4 for HMPV [ 8 ] . In Mali , contribution of HMPV to pneumonia had a population attributable fraction of 9 % ( 95 % CI : 7 - 11 % ) [ 9 ] ; while in Morocco [ 10 ] , 8 . 9 % of children < 5 years admitted with severe pneumonia were infected with HMPV . HMPV prevalence and incidence elsewhere globally , is indicated in Additional file 4 : Table S1 . Of note is that the variations in incidence rates could be attributed to study population , seasonality and even detection methods . Nonetheless , genomic epidemiology of HMPV in Africa is inadequately reported , and comparison of genetic similarity and differences between African and global strains is not documented .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 123}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 381}, "obj": "ne"}]}
