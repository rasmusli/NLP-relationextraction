Following the recent work of Aghaeepour and Hoos [ 61 ] and Hajiaghayi et al . [ 58 ] we calculate the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measure as follows . For each vector f of F - measures ( where , for example , f may be the F - measures of predictions obtained by Iterative HFold on pseudok structures ) we first take 10 4 resamples with replacement , where the resamples have the same length as the original sample vector f ( | f | ) , and then calculate their average F - measures . These 10 4 calculated average F - measures represent the bootstrap distribution for the vector f . We then report the 2 . 5th and 97 . 5th percentile of this distribution ( i . e . , the bootstrap distribution of the 10 4 average F - measures calculated above ) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively , and call it the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval . By reporting the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average F - measure of a method , A , on a data set , D , we say that we are 95 % confident that the average F - measure of method A on data set D is in the reported interval . All calculations are performed using the \" boot \" package of the R statistics software environment [ 62 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
