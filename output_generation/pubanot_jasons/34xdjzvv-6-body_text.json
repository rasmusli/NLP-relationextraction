The viral genomes in infected 3T3 - SCARB2 cells were detected by RT - PCR reaction using primers specifically targeting to VP1 sequence of P1 transcripts of E59 or 5746 isolates . The results show that N3 inhibited the expression of P1 of E59 and 5746 in a concentrationdependent manner . The quantities of the expressed P1 , compared to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were shown in a bar graph in Fig . 1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
