{"cord_uid": "rp35g91f", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5592927", "divid": "49", "text": "Taken together , a model is proposed whereby hemodynamic stress triggers mechanosensory ( stretch - stress ) signaling from the sarcomere and initiates NO signaling cascades from the adjacent pulmonary epithelia , which are transmitted back to the pulmonary myocardium myocyte nuclei ( Figure 5 ) . This leads to dynamic regulation of gene expression , enabling fine - tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium , such as the rate and force of contraction , as well as influencing blood volume , ion transport , and hormone signaling . Our findings indicate that genetic variability at these loci can modify levels of gene expression in the pulmonary myocardium , and could modify venous return to the left atrium as well as pathological features such as hypertrophy , fibrosis , and initiation of ectopic beats . Hence the genes / loci identified in this study could be linked to atrial fibrillation in humans triggered by pulmonary events . Indeed , these loci regulate genes that in humans are known to be associated with various heart diseases ( dilated cardiomyopathy , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , and arrhythmia ) and are therefore viable candidates for involvement in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 155}, "obj": "ne"}]}
