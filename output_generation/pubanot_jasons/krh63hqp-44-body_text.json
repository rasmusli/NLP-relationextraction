Based on our mutation count analysis , there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage , and it has gone extinct , apparently twice . From other studies , various influenza strains are obviously derived from reassortment , but all this does is set the mutation clock back a little . Any reassortment between a \" fresh \" virus and a high - mutation - count virus will inevitably lead to , at best , an averaging of the mutational load of the two . The 2009 - 2010 \" swine flu \" virus shows evidence of multiple re events in a limited portion of its genome , and it was more robust than the lingering human H1N1 strain that it replaced , but it carries a great number of non - adaptive and presumably deleterious mutations . Reassortment between two viruses of different immunological character might preserve the less degraded genome , but only temporarily .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
