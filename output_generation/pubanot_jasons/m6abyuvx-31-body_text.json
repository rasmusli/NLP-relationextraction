This result indicated that rVV - N25 may modulate inflammation via innate immunity , as well as via acquired immunity . Reportedly , Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) - dependent recognition pathways play a role in the recognition of poxviruses [ 27 ] . TLR2 and TLR9 have also been implicated in the recognition of the vaccinia virus [ 28 , 29 ] . These findings indicate that TLR on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV - N25 in our model of HCV infection ; however , further examination of this hypothesis is required . The finding that pathological symptoms in the HCV transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of TNF - a and IL - 6 neutralizing antibodies indicated that the progression of chronic hepatitis depended on inflammatory cytokines in serum , rather than the HCV protein levels in hepatocytes . Lymphocytes , macrophages , hepatocytes , and adipocytes each produce TNF - a and IL - 6 [ 30 , 31 ] , and HCV - infected patients have elevated levels of TNF - a and IL - 6 [ 32 , 33 ] . Both cytokines also contribute to the maintenance of hepatosteatosis in mice fed a high - fat diet [ 34 ] , and production of TNF - a and IL - 6 is elevated in obese mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [ 35 ] . These findings indicate that both cytokines are responsible for HCV - triggered hepatosteatosis , and anti - cytokine neutralization is a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis if antiviral therapy is not successful .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
