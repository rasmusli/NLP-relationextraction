By capturing a more realistic process of spatial spread , our novel approach results in more credible reconstructions of spatial evolutionary history , which may shed further light on the persistence and migration dynamics of human influenza viruses . Because of the importance of influenza dynamics for vaccine strain selection , different phylogeographic reconstructions have attempted to characterize the global population structure of the virus and have arrived at somewhat mixed findings [ 3 , 14 , 17 ] . This may be explained by the use of both different sampling and different methodology . The data and methods used here corroborate the explorations of antigenic and genetic divergence by [ 3 ] and demonstrate the prominence of mainland China and Southeast Asia as locations of trunk lineage persistence . Our findings are however based on roughly the same genetic data , and our approach of inferring the spatial history of the trunk lineage through Markov reward estimates may be viewed as the more direct , statistical equivalent of measuring strain location distance from the trunk [ 3 ] . Although we find a strong signal for the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and Southeast Asia , our analysis is restricted to the period 2002 to 2006 , and thus we make no conclusions about the location of the trunk lineage outside of this period . The degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal influenza and its heterogeneity among different influenza variants has yet to be determined and requires datasets of longer duration . Moreover , we suggest that analyses of future data sets that are more comprehensively sampled through time will also benefit from phylogeographic models that can accommodate temporal heterogeneity in movement rates . Such models may also improve the performance of some explanatory variables . For example , in the analysis presented here , we do not consider the absence of support for seasonality as a predictor in our GLM model as evidence against seasonality in H3N2 spread . Rather , it simply reflects the difficulty in incorporating seasonality into a time - homogeneous model of lineage movement . Developments are now underway to appropriately accommodate heterogeneity in spatial spread through time .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
