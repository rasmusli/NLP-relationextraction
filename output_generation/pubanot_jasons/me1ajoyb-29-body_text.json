Most colonies are established with wild rodents that are highly polymorphic . This limits use of traditional CTL assays that require MHC class I - matched target cells . The generation of highly inbred strains is challenging and may result in alleles that do not represent the natural biology of hantavirus infection , thus it may not be desirable to generate highly inbred rodents . It is possible to establish MHC homozygotes with controlled breeding and screening of littermates for the same haplotypes . Even then , the generation of susceptible cell lines can be problematic . While endothelial cell lines can be generated with retroviral transformation , it is possible the cells may have activated antiviral pathways that could alter in vitro CTL responses . The use of growth factors for expanding endothelial cells in culture may be more attractive . Until methods are established for generating syngeneic , susceptible target cells , assessment of CTL responses in reservoir hosts will be difficult .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
