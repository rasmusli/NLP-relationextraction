Ribosome pausing at structured RNA stimulators of PRF has been widely documented and may play a mechanistic role ( 2 ) . We tested whether the nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 complex could also induce pausing by cloning the PRRSV signal ( with a defective slippery sequence ) in - frame within a reporter gene and translating in vitro derived mRNAs in the WG system . The extent of pausing was estimated by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at a bound nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 complex with that of the full - length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine , a potent inhibitor of initiation , 5 min after the start of the reaction . A control mRNA was prepared from plasmid template linearized at the position of the inserted PRRSV signal to serve as a pause marker . As can be seen in Figure 7 , pausing was clearly evident in the presence of nsp1 \u2424 / PCBP2 , but far less so with either protein alone , or on an mRNA lacking the C - rich region . The appearance of the pause product was transient ( albeit visible over several minutes ) , consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather than a dead - end product . In Figure 7C , further pausing assays were carried out to examine the activity of the PCBP2 KH domain mutants ( in the presence of nsp1 \u2424 ) . We found a positive correlation between the extent of pausing observed and the activity of the three mutants in specific RNA binding , namely a little for PCBP2 KH1m , close to WT levels for PCBP2 KH2m and much less pausing for PCBP2 KH3m .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
