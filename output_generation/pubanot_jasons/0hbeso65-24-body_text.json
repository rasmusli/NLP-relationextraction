Humoral responses are often thought to play a key role in controlling HCV infection [ 81 ] . In clinical setting , patients spontaneously resolving from acute HCV infection tend to have an early induction of neutralizing antibody response . In contrast , chronic infection patients have a delayed initiation of neutralizing antibody response . Moreover , the variety of strategies the virus evolves to escape antibodies - mediated neutralization , including the accelerated evolution and the diversity of HCV [ 82 ] . Overall , the capacity of HCV to mutate continuously allows a high plasticity and an ability of the virus to adapt to variable environmental conditions and escape the host ' s immune responses leading to HCV persistene . HCV entry to the hepatocytes requires interaction of its viral envelope glycoproteins ( E1 and E2 ) and the cell membrane [ 83 ] . Both E1 and E2 contain putative fusion domains [ 84 ] . While little is known about the role of E1 in HCV entry , several domains in E2 have been defined to bind to CD 81 and scavenger receptor class B type I ( SR - BI ) , two important host factors ( described in the next paragraph ) . These interactions through E2 glycoprotein help HCV evade host immune responses and enter the hepatocytes . For example , hypervariate region 1 ( HVR1 ) , the first 27 amino acids of E2 , plays an important role in viral fitness . It has been demonstrated that HVR1 was involved in SR - BI - mediated HCV entry [ 85 ] . Therefore , HVR1 has been suggested to be a target for neutralizing antibodies , but its high variability results in poor crossneutralization potency of antibodies across different HCV isolates [ 86 ] . It is well known that host humoral responses are thought to play a critical role in controlling HCV infection . Several studies reported that broadly neutralizing antibodies might be directed against conserved conformational epitopes within E2 and mostly inhibit E2 - CD81 interaction [ 87 , 88 ] . Currently , new conformational and conserved epitopes have been identified in the N - terminal part of E2 [ 89 ] . The conserved nature of these epitopes holds great promise for the development of potent inhibitors for HCV entry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
