For the direct virus binding assay , plates were coated with HIV - 1 JR - FL ( 20 ng p24 / well ) for 2 hours at 37uC , washed with PBS and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk in PBS . After 1 hour at 37uC , plates were washed , antibodies were added in serial dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37uC . Detector antibody ( horse radish peroxidaselabeled goat anti - human Fc ) was added to the washed plate and incubated for 45 min at 37uC . Finally , plates were washed , developed ( TMB solution , Life Technologies ) , and read at 450 nm using a plate reader ( BioTek ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
