Of the three shelters in Melbourne , one did not vaccinate cats , while two vaccinated cats on admission , one using an inactivated vaccine and the other an MLV vaccine . All shelters that used vaccinations gave a primary course to kittens starting at a minimum age of 6 weeks , then every 3 to 4 weeks , finishing at 12 to 14 weeks of age , while adult cats were given two vaccinations one month apart . Both rescue societies , one in NSW and one in Victoria , accepted unvaccinated cats and kittens for adoption from municipal pounds ( shelters ) , that were fostered until adoption . For 177 shelter - housed cats , the median time from admission to diagnosis of FPL was 9 days ( IQR 0 - 17 ; range 0 - 61 days ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
