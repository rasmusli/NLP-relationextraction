In the presence of other chelating agents , the complex formation is disrupted , giving rise to a decrease of the red colour of the complex ferrozine - Fe 2 + . Measurement of the rate of colour reduction therefore allows estimation of the chelating activity of the coexisting chelator [ 46 ] . Essential oils of Myrtus communis , Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus generally did not present chelating activity [ 46 , 54 ] . The sole exception was the essential oils of flowers of myrtle . The authors [ 46 ] explained this activity to the presence of eugenol and methyl eugenol in its essential oil , whereas these two components only belong to a minor fraction of leaf and stem essential oils . These dihydroxylated compounds would be necessary to form chelated Fe 2 + . Leaf and stem oils had as main components 1 , 8 - cineole and terpinen - 4 - ol , monohydroxylated compounds that would be unable to chelate ferrous ions [ 46 ] . Concerning the essential oils of spice plants used in a Mediterranean diet , all of them were able to chelate Fe 2 + and did so in a concentration - dependent manner [ 52 ] . At all concentrations assayed Rosmarinus officinalis L . and Salvia officinalis essential oils showed the highest values for chelating Fe 2 + . All the oils studied were better chelators of Fe 2 + than ascorbic acid and BHT , used as references [ 52 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 83}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 133}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 289}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 294}, "obj": "ne"}]}
