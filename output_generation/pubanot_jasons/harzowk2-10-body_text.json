The serotype 19A is especially virulent and may be difficult to isolate in patients who have already been started on antibiotics . The pathogen has been reported to be associated with the hemolytic uremic syndrome [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . Penicillin can be used in sensitive pneumococcus [ 1 , 2 ] . In patient with pneumonia not responding satisfactory initially , more invasive investigative / therapeutic management including a pleural drain for biologic specimen is indicated to guide management . Local antimicrobial sensitivity in PICU patients has been reported [ 1 , 2 ] . The pathogen was sensitive to penicillin and cefotaxime in this case . In patients not responding satisfactorily with initial antibiotics but with known penicillin sensitivity , a higher dose of penicillin should be tried .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 331}, "obj": "ne"}]}
