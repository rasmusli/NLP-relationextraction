This is an important topic given the key role of the housing sector in tackling both air pollution and climate change . Although the methods used are relatively simplistic , they are appropriate for analyses performed at the scale presented in the paper . The findings and conclusions are well supported by the results . I would therefore support publication . However , I believe the manuscript would benefit from a stronger statement of the aims of the work and some clarifications regarding the methods ( see below ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
