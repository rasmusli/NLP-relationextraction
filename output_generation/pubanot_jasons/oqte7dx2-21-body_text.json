{"cord_uid": "oqte7dx2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5735123", "divid": "21", "text": "Similar to C . elegans , the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melonagaster encodes for one DUB , CG7023 , that is homologous to both USP46 and USP12 ( Moretti et al . , 2012 ; Tsou et al . , 2012 ) and one homolog each of WDR48 and WDR20 ( Table 1 ) . CG7023 / USP12 was shown to negatively regulate Notch signaling in flies ( Moretti et al . , 2012 ) . Partial RNAi knock - down of CG70 / USP12 in the fly nervous system did not reveal any obvious neuronal phenotypes ( Tsou et al . , 2012 ) . It will be informative to investigate the null phenotype of the WDR proteins and USP12 in the fly nervous system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
