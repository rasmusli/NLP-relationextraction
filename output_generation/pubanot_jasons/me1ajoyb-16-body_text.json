Using cDNA arrays , Klein et al . [ 77 ] identified nearly 2000 genes that were differentially expressed in male and female rats infected with SEOV . Many immune - associated transcription factors , proinflammatory , antiviral , T cell and Ig family member genes were significantly higher in females , which may reduce transmission from females .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
