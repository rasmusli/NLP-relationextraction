All the phylograms have essentially yielded geographic based clustering rather than time based clustering . The seven distinct clades that were clearly demarcated are : Thailand clade I ( Q2L700 ; Q2LDC8 ; Q2LDC0 ; Q6PUP7 ; Q307U7 ; Q45ZM8 ) , Thailand clade II ( Q5SDA6 ; Q307V5 ; Q6PUP6 ; Q5MD5 ) , Thailand clade III ( Q6B518 ; Q4PKD4 ) , Indian clade ( Q0PEF9 ; Q0PEG0 ) Scotland clade ( Q0A2H3 ; Q710U6 ) Bavarian clade ( A1EHP1 ; Workflow Scalability for large data sets A quick perusal of the results obtained with the three algorithms ( ProtPars , NJ and UPGMA ) has confirmed the pattern obtained from the core set . The strains of H5N1 _ NA cluster spatially rather than temporally or according to host . However , there are subtle differences amongst the outputs of the three algorithms with respect to their resolution . The clustering obtained using NJ seems to be better resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and sub - speciation . A detailed analysis of the Thai clade obtained by ProtPars also has revealed that all the sequences from the core set have been represented in this tree as well . The additional isolates are mostly fragments obtained through PCR amplification and uploaded to Uniprot . An interesting aspect of this clade is the finding that the entry Q5EP24 ( Chicken isolate from Vietnam ) is placed almost as an outlier in this group . It would be interesting to analyze the genealogies of Vietnam and Thailand clades and to verify whether there are any \" bridging \" isolates such as Q5EP24 that may play an important role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe . We have analyzed our medium dataset to confirm the pattern we obtained with the core set . A detailed analysis of each geographic clade with respect to the \" bridging \" isolates such as Q5EP24 may reveal a global pattern of H5N1 spread .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
