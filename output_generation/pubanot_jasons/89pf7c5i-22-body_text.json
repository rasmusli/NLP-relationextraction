Only two studies have been reported with different species of the Leishmania donovani complex and were both performed many years ago [ 39 , 45 ] . This means that sensitive techniques such as PCR were not applied for monitoring infected cats . A third study was conducted more recently in Brazil with L . braziliensis [ 46 ] .
