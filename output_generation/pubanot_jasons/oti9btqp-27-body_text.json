A consensus strategy was used and the consensus sequences were determined by the alignment of current ZIKV prME protein sequences . The vaccine insert was genetically optimised ( i . e . , codon and RNA optimisation ) for enhanced expression in humans and an IgE leader sequence was added to facilitate expression . The construct was synthesised commercially ( Gens , NJ , USA ) , and then subcloned into a modified pVax1 expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate - early promoter as described before . 25 The final construct is named ZIKV - prME vaccine and the control plasmid backbone is pVax1 . In addition , a number of other matched DNA constructs encoding the prM and E genes from MR766 ( DQ859059 . 1 ) and a 2016 Brazilian ( AMA12084 . 1 ) outbreak strain were also designed , for further evaluation . Large - scale amplifications of DNA constructs were carried out by Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc . ( Plymouth Meeting , PA , USA ) and purified plasmid DNA was formulated in water for immunisations . The size of the DNA inserts was confirmed via agarose gel electrophoresis . Phylogenetic analysis was performed by multiple alignment with ClustalW using MEGA version 5 software . 25 DNA immunisations and electroporation - mediated delivery enhancement Female C57BL / 6 mice ( 6 - 8 weeks old ) and IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice ( 5 - 6 weeks old ) were immunised with 25 \u03bcg of DNA in a total volume of 20 or 30 \u03bcl of water delivered into the tibialis anterior muscle with in vivo electroporation delivery . In vivo electroporation was delivered with the CELLECTRA adaptive constant current electroporation device ( Inovio Pharmaceuticals ) at the same site immediately following DNA injection . A three - pronged CELLECTRA minimally invasive device was inserted ~ 2 mm into the muscle . Square - wave pulses were delivered through a triangular threeelectrode array consisting of 26 - gauge solid stainless steel electrodes and two constant current pulses of 0 . 1 Amps were delivered for 52 msec / pulse separated by a 1 s delay . Further protocols for the use of electroporation have been previously described in detail . 26 The mice were immunised three times at 2 - week intervals and killed 1 week after the final immunisation . Blood and splenocytes were collected after each immunisation for the analysis of cellular and humoral immune responses . 25 Rhesus macaque immunogenicity studies : five rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally at two sites two times at 4 - week intervals with 2 mg ZIKV - prME vaccine . Electroporation was delivered at 0 . 2 Amps immediately using the same device described for mouse immunisations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
