The antioxidant activity of essential oils of five spice plants used in the Mediterranean diet that was evaluated through the TBARS method [ 52 ] was also evaluated through the Rancimat method in which the lipid substrate was lard . The system was heated at 120 \u00baC and an air flow of 20 L / h was constantly blown into the mixture . The end of the induction period was characterized by the sudden increase of water conductivity , due to the dissociation of volatile carboxylic acids . Their results showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare L . showed the best antioxidant activity index , as determined by the Rancimat method , but less than the activity of BHT ( synthetic standard ) . Carvacrol was the main component of the Origanum vulgare oil . In this case , an oil rich in phenolic components ( oregano ) and the other one ( thyme ) without great levels of these components presented similar activities , in contrast to that reported for the TBARS , in which thyme possessed the best activity [ 52 ] . This is a good example in which diverse methods of antioxidant evaluation may give rise different results , showing therefore the importance of using several methods to evaluate the enatioxidant activity of samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 108}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 122}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 330}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 429}, "obj": "ne"}]}
