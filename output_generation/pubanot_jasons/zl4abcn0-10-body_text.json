The HPLC analysis was carried out using Gilson HPLC System ( USA ) comprising of solvent delivery pump and ultraviolet ( UV ) detector connected to a Hitachi D - 2500 Chromato - integrator ( Tokyo , Japan ) for data collection . An Eclipse Plus reversed - phase C - 18 column ( 250 \u00d7 4 . 6 i . d . mm , 5 m particle size ; Agilent , USA ) was used for separation . The mobile phase used was acetonitrile - 1 % aqueous ammonium acetate buffer , pH 6 . 0 ( 15 : 85 v / v ) at the flow rate of 1 . 0 mL / min . The sample injection volume was 20 L and the wavelength of the detector was set at 325 nm .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 417}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 448}, "obj": "ne"}]}
