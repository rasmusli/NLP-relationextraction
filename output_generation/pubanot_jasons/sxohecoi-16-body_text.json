{"cord_uid": "sxohecoi", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3836734", "divid": "16", "text": "We evaluated the ability of HIVIG and a panel of mAbs with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH - dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV - 1 JRFL ; 50 % inhibitory concentrations ( IC 50 s ) of the antibodies ranged from 0 . 06 to . 50 mg / ml ( Fig . 3E ) . Both poorly neutralizing antibodies ( HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240 ; Figure 3A ) and neutralizing mAbs ( 4E10 , 2F5 , 2G12 , VRC01 , and b12 ; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6 . 0 . At 50 mg / ml , transcytosis correlated directly with mAb binding to HIV - 1 JRFL ( Spearman rho = 0 . 75 ; p = 0 . 052 ) and inversely with the IC 50 of the mAbs ( Spearman rho = 20 . 71 ; p = 0 . 050 ) ( Figure S5 ) . At pH 6 . 0 , all Env - specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM - bl cells ( Figure 3C and D ) . However , there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity ( IC 50 ) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis ( Spearman ' s rho = 0 . 86 ; p = 0 . 001 ) . Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG , F240 and b6 , at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg / ml , was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non - FcRn - dependent manner ( i . e . , in the presence of Den3 control mAb ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Conversely , transcytosis mediated by antibodies with the lowest IC 50 s , such as VRC01 and b12 , resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , strong binding activity results in more FcRn - dependent transcytosis , whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
