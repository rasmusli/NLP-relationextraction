Thus , small intestinal epithelial cell adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC is mediated by F4 - or F18 - specific receptors ( F4R or F18R ) , the existence and function of which are crucial in determining the susceptibility of pigs to ETEC infection [ 2 , 7 ] . The genetic predisposition of the pig is primordial for the development of PWD [ 28 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
