To identify the key molecules and signaling pathways that may mediate the inhibition of cell entry into S phase by EV - D68 , we examined the protein expression profiles of host G0 / G1 - phase and S - phase proteins by Western blotting of RD cells at 0 , 16 , 20 , 24 , and 28 h post - infection . Among the molecules CDK4 , CDK6 , and cyclinD ( which mediate cell cycle progression in G0 / G1 ; Massagu\u00e9 , 2004 ) and CDK2 and cyclinE1 ( which mediate cell cycle transition from G0 / G1 to S phase ; Hinds et al . , 1992 ) , the expression of CDK6 was not changed , and the expression of cyclinE1 was increased at 24 h post - infecion ( Figure 3B ) , while all of them were significantly decreased in virus - infected cells as compared to mock - infected cells at 28 h post - infection ( Figures 3B , G ) . Furthermore , the CDK2 mRNA level was decreased by EV - D68 infection ; however , there were no significant differences between the virus and mockinfected groups in CDK4 , CDK6 , cyclinD or cyclinE1 mRNA levels ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , EV - D68 infection inhibits host expression of several cell cycle proteins , which is consistent with its ability to inhibit G0 / G1 to S phase entry , and the modulation is likely to occur transcriptionally for CDK2 and post - transcriptionally for CDK4 , CDK6 , cyclinD , and cyclinE1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 211}, "obj": "ne"}]}
