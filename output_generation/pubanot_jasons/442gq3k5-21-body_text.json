Characteristics of the participants S . suis infection occurred sporadically throughout the year without any clear seasonality ( Figure 3 ) . Clustering of cases was not observed . Ninety - seven patients ( 96 % ) were infected with S . suis serotype 2 while only four patients ( 4 % ) were infected with other serotypes , including serotype 14 ( 3 cases ) and untypeable serotype ( 1 case ) . S . suis cases were predominantly male ( 82 % ) and from a rural residence ( 81 % ) with a median ( IQR ) age of 50 ( 41 - 59 ) years . Twenty - one percent of cases had an occupation related to pigs , other exposure to pigs ( 46 % ) , or reported eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the two weeks prior to admission ( 48 % ) . Hospital and community controls were more frequently female and ( unmatched ) hospital controls were significantly younger , with a higher proportion of urban residence ( Table 3 ) . We further analyzed the age distribution of cases , hospital controls and non - S . suis bacterial meningitis patients amongst the hospital controls . Nearly 70 % of S . suis meningitis patients were older than 45 years , while only 25 % of non - S . suis meningitis patients and 20 % of all hospital controls belonged to this age group ( Table 4 ) . The 49 hospital controls with bacterial meningitis ( not S . suis ) were significantly younger than S . suis cases with median ( IQR ) age of 27 ( 23 - 45 ) compared to 50 ( 41 - 59 ) years ( p , 0 . 001 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
