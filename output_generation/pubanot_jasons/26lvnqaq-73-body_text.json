Overfeeding , stress , genetics and improper lighting may all determine the occurrence of this syndrome , but in some cases , single factors such as viral infections of the reproductive tract ( e . g . infectious bronchitis , Newcastle disease , HPAI viruses ) can trigger the disease regardless of other managerial issues [ 37 ] . If bacterial agents as E . coli gain access to the peritoneum , either via reverse per along the oviduct or crossing of the intestinal barrier [ 38 ] , the peritonitis becomes septic and more likely to bring the animal to a severe pathological state including lethargy , ascites , abdominal swelling and weight loss . In light of this , and considering the good health status of birds at the end of the study , together with the granulomatous peritonitis and the altered architecture of the infundibulum , we speculate that the presence of yolk in the abdomen was the result of erratic oviposition [ 37 ] due to a chronic damage of the oviduct . According to these evidences , the observed pathological picture could fall under the definition of non - septic egg peritonitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
