For example , both vaccinia virus [ 17 ] and herpes simplex virus [ 18 ] require ADP - ribosylation activity for viral replication . Moreover , diverse RNA viruses , such as alphaviruses , hepatitis E virus , rubella virus and SARS coronavirus encode one or more macrodomains , potentially conferring the ability to specifically recognize , and possibly reverse , ADPribosylation upon these viruses [ 19 ] . Mutations in the macrodomain of Sindbis virus led to reduced virulence in mice [ 20 ] . Similarly , mutations in the SARS coronavirus macrodomain sensitized the virus to the antiviral effects of the signaling cytokine , interferon ( IFN ) [ 21 ] . As IFN functions as one of the primary mediators of the innate immune system against viruses [ 22 ] , these results indicate that macrodomains , and therefore ADP - ribosylation , could be important viral regulators of host immunity . Moreover , host PARP genes can play a direct role in antiviral immunity . For example , overexpression of PARP13 , also known as ZAP or ZC3HAV1 ( Zinc - finger CCCH - type antiviral protein 1 ) , is sufficient to restrict replication of several different families of viruses , including a retrovirus ( murine leukemia virus [ 23 ] ) , filoviruses ( Ebola and Marburg [ 24 ] ) , a togavirus ( Sindbis [ 25 ] ) and a hepadnavirus ( Hepatitis B virus [ 26 ] ) . This antiviral activity is mediated through direct binding of viral RNA by PARP13 , followed by recruitment of the exosome and specific degradation of viral RNA [ 27 , 28 ] , although more recently , additional signaling roles for PARP13 have been proposed [ 14 , 29 ] . Beyond the welldescribed PARP13 - mediated antiviral functions , PARP1 , 7 , 10 and 12 have been shown to play roles in repressing viral replication [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ] , although the mechanisms of these antiviral actions are unknown . While these results indicate that there may be a role for individual PARPs in regulating viral infectivity or pathogenesis , there has been no cohesive model for how ADP - ribosylation may influence host - viral interactions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
