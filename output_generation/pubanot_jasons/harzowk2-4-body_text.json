Shortly , the patient became lethargic with cold peripheries , cyanosis , and insucking chest . She was given normal saline boluses and dobutamine ( 10 mcg / kg / min ) and promptly transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . There , she received cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( 13 minutes ) because of cardiopulmonary failure , septic shock , and bradycardia . She was ventilated and treated with intravenous cefotaxime , high dose ampicillin , vancomycin , clarithromycin , packed cell , fresh frozen plasma , and cryoprecipitate transfusions . Abnormal laboratory findings included hemoglobulin 8 . 0 g / dL , platelets 87 \u00d7 10 9 / L , and white cell count 1 \u00d7 10 9 / L ; activated partial thromboplastin time APTT was 47 . 9 seconds , prothrombin time PT 13 . 4 seconds , d - dimer 2192 ng / mL , C - reactive protein 51 . 9 mg / L , plasma urea 18 . 2 mmol / L , creatinine 214 umol / L . Her lowest PaO 2 / FiO 2 was 42 , and arterio - alveolar gradient 610 mmHg . Echocardiography showed reduced cardiac contractility ( ejection fraction 48 % ) but no pericardial effusion . The pleural effusion was drained , and 40 mL of dark turbid fluid 2 Case Reports in Medicine yielded ( Figure 1 insert ) . Despite multiple inotrope infusions of dobutamine , adrenaline , noradrenaline , and milrinone , her mean blood pressure remained low ( 50 mmHg ) and she suffered another episode of cardiac arrest 9 hours following admission . Hemodiafiltration was instituted for intractable septic shock , renal failure , acidosis , and fluid retention . The patient ran a deteriorating course despite aggressive ICU support . She developed another episode of cardiac arrest and succumbed 39 hours following hospitalization . Nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates yielded Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( by polymerase chain reaction PCR ) and human Metapneumovirus RNA ( by RT - PCR ) . Blood culture , pleural fluid , and tracheal aspirate yielded leucocytes and Streptococcus pneumoniae ( serotype 19A ) sensitive to cefotaxime and penicillin . CSF was not obtained during the critical episode .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 175}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 324}, "obj": "ne"}]}
