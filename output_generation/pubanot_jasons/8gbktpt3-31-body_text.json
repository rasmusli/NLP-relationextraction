EU498680 ) and two sequences that are very closely related to the vaccine strain . In one of these , from a 6 - week - old kitten with acute vomiting and failure to gain weight , the vaccine strain was unlikely to be the cause of the cat ' s clinical signs . FPL was suspected because a multiplex qPCR faecal panel was positive for Giard spp . and Canine protoparvovirus 1 . However , the cat , from Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory , had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine strain .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
