In the new model , isolation of newly infectious cases occurs at a daily rate of d I after a delay of s D days , which represents a period when infected individuals are infectious but asymptomatic or undetectable ( I A ) . A fraction q of those who had contact with an infectious and symptomatic individual ( I S ) ( but did not contract the infection ) are removed to the quarantined susceptible class , S Q , where they spend exactly s Q days . An identical fraction of newly exposed individuals is also quarantined . Full details of the model equations are given in Protocol S1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
