The amounts of viral DNA and RNA isolated from cells grown with or without HSV DNA polymerase inhibitor ( Phosphonoacetic acid , PAA ) in the culture media were analyzed by quantitative real - time PCR ( Figure 5 ) . PAA inhibited the synthesis of HSV DNA in infected cells and the activity of the virus - specific DNA polymerase in vitro [ 33 ] . PAA was used to investigate the antiviral effects by 3D8 scFv DNase activity in the immediate early stage before de novo viral DNA replication . The changes in viral DNA content in HeLa , SCH07072 , and muSCH cells were traced at immediate early ( 2 hr after virus challenge , ICP4 ) , early ( 6 . 5 hr after virus challenge , UL9 ) , and late ( 25 hr after virus challenge , UL19 ) stages of infection ( Figure 5A ) . Viral DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells was reduced by up to 94 . 2 % under the PAA - untreated condition , compared to HeLa cells at each stage . Virus DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by up to 80 % compared to that in HeLa cells at all stages of infection . In contrast , muSCH cells under the PAA - untreated condition showed as much virus DNA accumulation as HeLa cells at the early stage of infection , but 68 % more viral DNA was detected in muSCH cells compared to HeLa cells at the late stage . The accumulation of virus DNA in SCH07072 indicates that nuclear 3D8 scFv can degrade viral DNA directly , resulting in less accumulation of viral DNA ( Figure 5B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 268}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 274}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 358, "end": 362}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 493}, "obj": "ne"}]}
