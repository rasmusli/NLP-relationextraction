Does mutation accumulation really have anything to do with virulence ? Simonsen , et al . [ 2 ] showed mortality statistics for three influenza strains over multiple years ( H1N1 from 1918 to 1987 ; H2N2 from 1958 to 1962 ; and H3N2 from 1968 to 1995 ) . Even though there is some debate concerning the mortality burden imposed by influenza viruses [ 63 ] , there has clearly been a continuous exponential decline in influenza - related mortality over time , and this is true for all three major serotype . Since there is a strong linear correlation between mutation count and time ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , and since there is also a close correlation between declining virus - related death rates and time , there is obviously also a correlation between mutation count and reduced death rates . Reduction in mortality may be due to many other factors , including herd immunity , advances in medicine , and advances in hygiene , but would these other factors be expected to follow so tightly the time courses seen in Simonsen ? There have been major medical advances since 1918 , and these have clearly been a factor in reducing H1N1 - related mortalities . Therefore , the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some . However , while it is certainly true that medical intervention has greatly improved in the developed world since 1918 , such medical intervention has been much more limited in the rest of the world . Second , the observed decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve , while medical advances have occurred in bursts ( e . g . , the breakthrough in antibiotics , and the more recent development of antivirals ) . Third , each of the great influenza pandemics ( 1918 , 1956 , 1968 ) involved the emergence of a new viral strain , which then followed its own exponential decline in mortality but within its own timeframe . This uncouples reduction in mortality and stage of medical advance . Finally , the correlation between the exponential decline of H1N1 - related mortalities and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1 . Our other evidences include : a ) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain ; b ) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956 , and then again apparently in 2009 ; and c ) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity , approaching random codon usage .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
