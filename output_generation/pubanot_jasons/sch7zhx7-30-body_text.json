To directly measure viral protease activity in cells , we generated a protease - sensitive dual luciferase reporter system . In this split luciferase system , cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly luciferase activity , which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control . This system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion . To generate this system , we cloned a 2A target sequence - MTNTGAFG - and a 3C target sequence - AMEQG - into the firefly luciferase reporter [ 37 ] . We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression . These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO . Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity . We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ) , protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment , to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 \u00b5M . These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity , and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 79}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 133}, "obj": "ne"}]}
