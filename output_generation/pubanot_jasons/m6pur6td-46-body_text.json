( 1 ) Coal consumption in energy mix should be further decreased , while relatively low carbon energy such as natural gas should be accelerated both in the industrial and residential sectors . Renewable energy such as solar PV and hydropower should also be encouraged . ( 2 ) Efficiency of thermal power generation should be further improved in Guangzhou , especially the major power plants such as the Pearl River power plant and the Huarun power plant in Nansha district , the Guangzhou power plant in Liwan district , the Hengyun power plant , the Huangpu power plant , and the Ruiming power plant in Huangpu district . ( 3 ) Energy consumption structure and energy utilization technique should be also effectively optimized and improved , especially in the pillar industries ( i . e . electronic information manufacturing industry , automobile industry , and petrochemical industry ) , the traditional advantage industries ( i . e . iron and steel , shipbuilding , machinery and equipment , paper , and textile etc . ) and the new and high technology industries ( i . e . software , new material , new energy , and digital industry etc . ) in Guangzhou in the current and near future .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 396}, "obj": "ne"}]}
