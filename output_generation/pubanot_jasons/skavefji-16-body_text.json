Of the 98 patients with bacterial pneumonia or viral pneumonia , the median duration of antimicrobial therapy before bronchoscopic BAL was 5 days ( interquartile range , 3 - 9 days ) . The median total WBC count ( 395 / mL vs . 200 / mL , P = 0 . 52 ) and percentage of neut ( 69 . 0 % vs . 67 . 0 % , P = 0 . 26 ) were not significantly different between these two groups . Figure S1 shows the changes recorded in the BAL fluid total WBC count and percentage of neutrophils according to the duration of exposure to antimicrobial agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
