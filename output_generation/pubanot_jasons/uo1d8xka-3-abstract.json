In particular , we focus on how this task can be effectively performed in a distributed computing environment . As a proof of concept , the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of H5N1 isolates ( micro level ) and influenza viruses ( macro level ) . The results of this paper are hence twofold . Firstly , this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed work for large - scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes . Secondly , the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus ' s tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
