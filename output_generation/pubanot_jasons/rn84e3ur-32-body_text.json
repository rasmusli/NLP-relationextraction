Similar to Figure 3 , Figure 4 shows that the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes decrease quickly . For case 1 , at 30 s after the injections , the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes are smaller than 10 \u2212 3 . For case 2 , the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 18 \u03bcm remain larger than 10 \u2212 3 until 43 s after the injections . For case 3 , the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 22 \u03bcm are still larger than 10 \u2212 3 even after 50 s after the injections . So the movement of the standing person can significantly lower the deposition and removal rates of all aerosol sizes . From Figure 4 ( a ) ~ ( c ) , similarity can also be found between the characteristics of the deposition and removal rates of different aerosol sizes . The suspended fractions of larger aerosols decrease more quickly than that of smaller aerosols . These characteristics are not affected by human movement .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
