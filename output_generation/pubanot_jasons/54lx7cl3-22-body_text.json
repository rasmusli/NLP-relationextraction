{"cord_uid": "54lx7cl3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4801059", "divid": "22", "text": "In this review , we discussed how the respiratory tract is an ecosystem with two niches , the URT and the LRT ; each with ecological and microbial pressures that determine bacterial selection . We hypothesized that viruses influence bacterial selection in the URT leading to colonization of the LRT and sometimes pneumonia . There appears to be a complex network of interactions among viruses and bacteria in the URT that responds to viral introduction by altering what bacteria are present or modifying their relative abundance . For a least one species , S . pneumoniae , viruses can increase nasopharyngeal carriage density and increase risk of p pneumonia . Whether this is true for other URT bacteria that cause pneumonia is uncertain . We also proposed that bacterial selection in the LRT could be altered by viral infection . The LRT is normally inhabited by low density of microbes , a state maintained by local host defenses and bacterial mechanisms of evasion . In vitro and in vivo studies suggest viruses can promote entry and colonization of the LRT for select bacterial species via a range of biological mechanisms including URT biofilm dispersion , increased bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cell by upregulation of cell receptors , reduced pulmonary clearance , impairment of multiple components of the innate immune response and changes in inflammatory response . Although there are limitations in interpreting the results of experiments , evidence of numerous mechanisms observed under various conditions strongly suggest that viruses also play an important role in the selection of bacteria in the LRT and pneumonia etiology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
