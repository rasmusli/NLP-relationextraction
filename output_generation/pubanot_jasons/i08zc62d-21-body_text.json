To predict how diplacone would interact with human silalidase counterparts , we modelled human sialidases ( Neu1 , Neu3 and Neu4 ) using the previously determined Neu2 structure and compared the specificity of diplacone with C . perfringens and human sialidases ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . The Cp - NanI catalytic domain with bound diplacone was superimposed with the crystal structure of human Neu2 with bound 2 - deoxy - 2 , 3 - dehydro - N - acetylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac ) and models of human Neu1 , Neu3 and Neu4 that were constructed using Neu2 as a template . The geranyl group of diplacone is essential for inhibition of the bacterial enzyme as it occupies a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe353 , Thr487 and Tyr587 . In human Neu proteins the corresponding residues are polar and would not interact favourably with the geranyl group ( Fig . 4b ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 161}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 270}, "obj": "ne"}]}
