The weights that appear in { D k , t } are defined using the form of the time series model and a filter , { a l } say . Extreme positive values of the detection process at a time point indicate a possible outbreak signature . The definition of the detection processes has its origin in process control [ 5 ] , and is popularly used in the context of bio [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] 6 , 8 ] . Naturally , the form of the filter has an important effect in the detection process .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
