This is shown to have a superantigen response mechanism . Similarly , mice developed coronary artery inflammation after intraperitoneal injection with Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract . Pathogenesis in this model parallels KD in that younger mice are more predisposed to develop arteritis and there is a favorable response to IVIG treatment . This disease exhibits mostly a T - cell infiltrate in coronary arterial specimens [ 42 ] . In fact , in both RAG - 1 [ 73 ] and TCR - \u03b1 [ 74 ] deficient mice , this arteritis is diminished [ 75 ] . Other models depend on immune complex deposition . This was observed after bovine serum albumin injection into rabbits , which exhibited a disease similar to serum sickness [ 76 ] . A number of the model systems have granulomatous changes , which have variably been seen in human specimens [ 77 ] . Presently , there is not a model system consistent with direct infectious coronary artery invasion nor that exactly replicates the pathologic changes seen in humans [ 78 ] . Considering that the cause in humans is unknown , it is unclear if any of these models of arteritis are truly applicable . Although most data from model systems are supportive of superantigen involvement , studies from human peripheral lymphocyte responses are variable and inconsistent [ 79 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 272, "end": 310}, "obj": "ne"}]}
