Collectively , this indicates that at least 50 % of the genes in the pulmonary myocardium gene network are bound by NKX2 - 5 in heart tissue at some point during development . We also examined NKX2 - 5 enrichment at our candidate pulmonary myocardium control loci on Chr1 and Chr2 and found NKX2 - 5 enrichment at Rab23 , Zfp451 , and Nostrin in the He et al . data set . Although tissue - specific regulatory mechanisms may differ between the heart and the pulmonary myocardium , this is strong evidence to support the theory that NKX2 - 5 could directly regulate expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
