To examine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on both peripheral and CNS mononuclear cells , we used PLX5622 , which reportedly depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [ 37 , 41 ] . Mice were provided either control chow or PLX5622 - embedded chow for 2 weeks , after which microglia numbers were assessed by flow cytometry using the microglia - specific marker P2RY12 ( Additional file 1 ) and by immunohistochemistry using Iba1 ( Additional file 2 ) . Quantification shows that 2 weeks of PLX5622 treatment reduced microglia in the CNS by 90 - 95 % ( Additional file 1 A - F , P , Q ) . Specificity of P2RY12 for CNS - resident microglia is demonstrated by lack of staining in leukocytes isolated from peripheral immune compartments ( Additional file 1 G - O ) . Within the CNS , PLX5622 treatment significantly depleted microglia across hippocampal , cortical , and cerebellar brain regions ( Additional file 2 ) . To determine whether PLX5622 treatment depleted mononuclear cells in peripheral immune compartments , we assessed numbers of antigen - presenting cells ( APCs , Fig . 1 ) and T cells ( Additional file 3 ) in the spleen and blood of uninfected mice in control versus PLX5622 - treated mice . PLX5622 treatment significantly reduced circulating CD11c + ( Fig . 1a - c ) , MHCII + CD11c + ( Fig . 1d - f ) , and CD11b neg CD11c + ( Fig . 1g - i ) cells in the blood . In the spleen , however , there was no significant difference in populations of APCs with PLX5622 treatment ( Fig . 1j - r ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 293}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 460}, "obj": "ne"}]}
