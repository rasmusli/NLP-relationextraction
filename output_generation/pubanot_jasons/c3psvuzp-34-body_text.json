We eliminated from further analysis any PARP sequences that contained frameshifts or nonsense mutations , but retained some genes that were missing up to three exons within genome assembly gaps . Protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW [ 68 ] with manual adjustment and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees ( 1000 bootstrap replicates ) were constructed using PhyML [ 69 ] using the best - fitting evolutionary model ( JTT + I + G + F ) as determined by Prottest [ 70 ] . Trees were displayed using MEGA [ 71 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
