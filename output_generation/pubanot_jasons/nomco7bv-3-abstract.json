Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ( adjusted OR = 2 . 02 , 95 % CI = 1 . 36 - 3 . 00 ) and upper RTIs ( adjusted OR = 1 . 55 , 95 % CI = 1 . 22 - 1 . 96 ) . Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables did only marginally affect ORs . Strat analyses suggested a stronger association for women and effect modifications by sports activity and dietary habits .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
