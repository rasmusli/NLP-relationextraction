The majority of cats in this study presented with chronic vomiting represented in 25 of the 28 cats ( 89 % ) . There were no statistical differences between dietary treatments in the weekly mean vomiting frequency or change in weekly vomiting frequency over time . However , looking within dietary groups , cats fed Diet A showed a significant reduction in vomiting occurrences in weeks 2 - 4 compared to baseline , with a 63 % reduction in the final week compared to baseline . Cats fed Diet B , while not reaching statistical significance , also showed a numerical reduction from baseline over the study period . Follow - up studies with additional cats are needed to better define the efficacy of Diet B and any potential differences between dietary treatments .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
