The baseline estimates assume that 90 % of the outdoor PM 2 . 5 mass concentration penetrates indoors . In addition , realistic but increasingly challenging penetration levels of 70 % and 50 % were evaluated . These correspond to effective filtration of PM 2 . 5 mass concentration by 27 % and 45 % , respectively , filtration levels that can be achieved in real buildings at least when using mechanical ventilation systems [ 13 ] . When discussing the filtration efficiencies of filters and the above mentioned penetration efficiencies , it has to be noted that the - 11 - penetration efficiency is defined for the building , accounting for leaks and ventilation from windows , doors etc .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
