Firstly , we evaluated the timing and routes of viral spread to the organs by RRT - PCR analysis of both the cellular and non - cellular fractions of the blood but we could not detect virus RNA . Even though we consider these negative results as the possible consequence of both a suboptimal sensitivity of the molecular techniques applied and the limited sampling times , we should also consider that H9N2 viruses have been rarely detected in the blood of chickens [ 39 , 40 ] , either in the presence of a S . aureus co - infection [ 10 ] or after a combination of an intranasal and intratracheal challenge [ 41 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
