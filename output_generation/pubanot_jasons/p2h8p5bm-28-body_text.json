Mice lacking IFNAR all succumbed within 6 days of infection , whereas 80 % of WT mice ( 6 - 8 - week - old ) survived the infection . Interestingly , all IFN\u03b2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice survived the infection , demonstrating that the IFN\u03b1s can compensate for loss of IFN\u03b2 in LGTV infection . Furthermore , IFNAR was shown to be a critical determinant of LGTV tropism as LGTV RNA was found in all organs in the absence of IFNAR , whereas in WT , only low viral burdens can be detected in the olfactory bulb [ 99 , 128 , 141 ] . Using transgenic mice , it was further shown that the IFN response was needed both in the peripheral tissue , as well as locally in the CNS , in order to clear LGTV infection [ 99 , 100 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
