In one of these papers , a 60 % drop in egg production in the first 7 days pi was associated with deposition of soft - shell eggs and a sudden decrease in the content of calcium in the eggshell , together with a reduction in the egg - shell thickness , confirming an overall preference of this virus for the chicken uterus [ 18 ] . These data and ours indicate that H9N2 viruses with a specific tropism for the chicken oviduct might have different anatomical preferences within the organ and this consistently translates into different pathological and productive scenarios .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 487}, "obj": "ne"}]}
