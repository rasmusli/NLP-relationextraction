The three most highly infected counties on the full network are Cumbria , North Yorkshire and Aberdeenshire , with mean epidemic sizes of 210 , 258 and 238 , respectively . When markets are included , we observe much larger epidemics in Devon , Somerset and northeast Wales . We also observe that each of the three sampling methods compares well with the original network at the S min threshold . Similar results are observed when outbreaks are seeded in Aberdeenshire and Devon - transmission within markets results in outbreaks with a much larger spatial extent than outbreaks in which markets do not play a role in transmission ( electronic supplementary material , figures S21 - S24 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
