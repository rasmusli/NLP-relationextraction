Michalik and Desvergne ( Center for Integrative Genomics , University of Lausanne , Lausanne , Switzerland ) and have been reported previously [ 17 ] . The PDK1 promoter construct contains [UNK] 663 bp of the human PDK1 promoter connected to the pGL 2 vector . Briefly , normal bronchial epithelial cells were seeded at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 per well in 24 - well dishes and grown to 50 - 60 % confluence . For each well , 0 . 4 \u03bcg of the above PDK1 plasmid DNA constructs , with or without 0 . 5 \u03bcg of the internal control phRL - TK Synthetic Renilla Luciferase Reporter Vector , were co - transfected into the cells using lipofectamine 2000 reagent . After 24 h of incubation , cells were treated with or without dmPGE 2 for 4 h . The preparation of cell extracts and measurement of luciferase activities were carried out using the Dual - Luciferase Reporter kit according to recommendations by the manufacturer ( Promega ) . The assays for firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were performed sequentially in a Labsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer equipped with dual injectors . Changes in firefly luciferase activity were calculated and plotted after normalization with changes in Renilla luciferase activity within the same sample .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
