Cullin - RING ubiquitin ligases are responsible for ubiquitylation of target proteins . To determine whether degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 occurs by ubiquitylation , Culex cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 ( or GFP dsRNA as control ) . The cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates collected 48 hours post - infection . Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti - ubiquitin antibody , followed by Western blot using anti - ubiquitin and anti - CxSTAT antibodies . The results ( Fig 5E ) showed that STAT was co - immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin after WNV infection in control ( GFP dsRNA ) cells , indicating ubiquitylation of CxSTAT . CxSTAT was not co - immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 . The results suggest that CxCul4 plays a major role in ubiquitylation of CxSTAT after WNV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
