Some identified protein was lost in the corresponding reporter group , giving no quantification information . The specific information and re - identification will be published in a future study . The 16 proteins that were identified using iTRAQ were classified into six categories , based on protein function ( Fig . 1 ) . The five proteins that demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression and the most significant correlation with liver diseases were verified using western blot : CRP precursor , hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S - Wake , apolipoprotein J precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and VN ( Fig . 2 and Table IV ) . Two of the five proteins were not classified according to biological processes ( apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
