We knocked down FcRn in HEC - 1A cells , verifying lower expression by flow cytometry and by Western blot ( Figure S3A ) . The knock - down HEC - 1A cells attained the same level of electrical resistance as did the wild - type cells ( data not shown ) , indicating that FcRn knockdown did not affect the ability to form tight junctions . Unlike with wild - type HEC - 1A cells , there was no enhanced transcytosis with Fc - knockdown HEC - 1A cells when either mAb 2F5 ( Figure 2A ) or polyclonal HIVIG ( data not shown ) were used . We also evaluated Fc mutants of the HIV - 1 Env - specific mAb b12 . A mutant designed to abrogate FcRn binding ( I253A ) , markedly lowered transcytosis compared with wild - type b12 ( Figure 2B ) [ 36 ] . The second mutant ( M428L ) , designed to bind with higher affinity to FcRn , increased transcytosis compared with wild - type b12 ( Figure 2B ) [ 37 ] . Binding to HIV - 1 JRFL gp120 ( Figure S3B ) and neutralization of HIV - 1 JRFL ( Figure S3C ) were nearly equivalent for the wild - type and Fc mutant versions of b12 , indicating that the Fc mutations did not affect Fab - antigen binding .
