It is a multifunctional plasma glycoprotein produced by hepatocytes that is detectable in plasma and the extracellular matrix . Glycosylation of VN modulates multimerization and collagen binding in liver regeneration ( 20 ) and alterations in VN glycosylation modulate substrate adhesion to rat hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , which is responsible for matrix restructuring ( 21 ) . Immunoblotting data identified increases in VN levels in cirrhotic livers , and VN immunoreactivity has been shown to be markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver matrix , irrespective of the apparent reduction in plasma VN . VN immunoreactivity in the liver may be considered to be a marker of fibrosis , particularly for chronic / mature fibrosis , paralleling previous observations concerning the enhanced orcein staining of cirrhotic septa ( 22 ) . These results suggest that VN may be important in the progression of liver disease and / or in hepatic fibrosis through its collagen - binding domain I , and that VN levels are likely to be higher in patients with chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis and liver cancer than in controls ( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) . In the present study , VN levels decreased in the progression of hepatitis B ( from CHB to HBV - induced ACLF ) . The observation of decreased VN levels was consistent with two other studies ( 24 , 25 ) . In one of these studies , it was demonstrated that , in chronic liver disease , the concentration of plasma VN was significantly lower than in healthy controls and was associated with the severity of liver disease . Notably , levels of VN in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patients with chronic liver disease compared with those in normal controls . These results suggested that VN was deposited in injured tissue during the repair process and functioned as an adhesive protein ( 24 ) . In the other study , it was demonstrated that there were lower levels of plasma VN in chronic liver disease , which was possibly due to a decreased synthesis , deposition in injured tissues or a combination of the two ( 25 ) . The same group of authors also revealed that decreased levels of plasma VN and fibronectin ( FN ) and increased levels of serum laminin ( LM ) P1 in patients with chronic liver diseases were associated with hepatic dysfunction , and that changes in the levels of the glycoproteins involved in cell attachment were significant in the development of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases ( 25 ) . Based on the accumulating information on VN and liver fibrosis , it appears that VN requires further study .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
