In LGTV infection , NS5 was shown to inhibit the JAK - STAT pathway and NS5 was shown to interact with the IFNAR receptor [ 148 ] . Similarly , it was shown that NS5 of TBE interacts with scribble ( hScrib ) which mediates NS5 localization to the plasma membrane and this interaction enables NS5 to inhibit type I and type II IFN mediated JAK - STAT signaling [ 178 ] . Knockdown of hScrib altered NS5 cellular localization and reversed the inhibition of the JAK - STAT signaling [ 178 ] . Further studies revealed that NS5 of TBEV inhibited the cell surface expression of IFNAR1 by binding to prolidase ( PEPD ) [ 182 ] . PEPD is a peptidase that is needed for IFNAR1 maturation and subsequent cell surface expression . NS5 binding of PEPD prevented maturation of complex N - linked oligosaccharides on IFNAR1 , which in turn disrupted its surface expression ( Figure 4B ) [ 179 , 182 ] . In KFDV infection , IFN treatment failed to reduce viral titers when added after infection , this effect was also found to be mediated by the NS5 proteins antagonism [ 180 , 183 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
