As for IFN - s , which are important mucosal antiviral factors produced by respiratory epithelial cells , we did not detect a significant increase at the transcriptional level , confirming the relatively silent infection of the nasal epithelium , which could enable JEV to bypass the first line of immune defenses of the upper respiratory tract . This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on NEC and by the observed induction of SOCS1 , a potent negative regulator of the IFN pathway and consequently also of the expression of IFN - stimulated genes ( 61 ) . This is in accordance with a report describing SOCS1 induction during JEV infection ( 36 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 60}, "obj": "ne"}]}
