NS3 contains major antigenic epitopes and plays an important role in the diagnosis of HCV infection , particularly in early HCV infection ( 21 ) . In this study , to our knowledge , our results demonstrate for the first time that a new NS3 segment ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) shows strong reactivity in 95 . 6 % of RT - PCRpositive samples and can act as a potential tool for the diagnosis of HCV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
