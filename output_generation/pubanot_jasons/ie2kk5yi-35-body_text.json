Pairwise similarity ( % ) between the 35 vampire bat - associated Bartonella sequences from this study , calculated with Kimura ' s 2 - parameters distance model . Sequences with greater than 96 % similarity were assumed to be part of the same genotype for downstream analyses . ( CSV ) S3 Table . Pairwise similarity ( % ) between each vampire bat Bartonella genotype from this study and the top 10 BLAST hits from GenBank . ( CSV ) S4 Table . Bartonella - like reads and contigs detected in pooled saliva and fecal samples using metagenomics . Department describes where samples in a pool were taken . Bartonellalike reads were identified by Diamond protein blast , and read matches are a list of those that were identified as Bartonella based on nucleotide blast . Bartonella - like contigs were identified by Diamond protein blast , and contig matches are a list of those that were identified as Bartonella based on nucleotide blast . Length is contig length in base pairs , and K - mer coverage is the depth of coverage for the largest k - value used in the SPAdes assembly . Table ) , and sequences from recent studies of bat and rodent Bartonella from Brazil . Bartonella seqeunces from our study are listed with genotype , bat ID numbers , and accession numbers . Sequences from GenBank are colored by host taxa and provided with accession numbers , host species , and sampling location ; red tips display recent gltA sequences from Brazilian bats and rodents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
