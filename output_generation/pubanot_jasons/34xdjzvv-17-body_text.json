In our study , we showed that N3 protected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice from being infected ( Fig . 4 ) ; viral load from different tissues ( CNS and muscle ) of N3 - treated hSCARB2 - transgenic mice was markedly reduced in contrast to non - treated groups ( Fig . 5 - 6 ) . These results indicate that the reduction of viral load in the compartment of CNS by N3 may correlate to the protection . Indeed , several studies of people and mice have also suggested the possibility of EV71 - induced immunopathogenesis [ 19 , 32 ] . Clinical , radiological , and laboratory features indicated that immunpathology resulting in neurological disease were reported in severe cases [ 33 ] . Elevated levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE [ 13 , 15 ] . CXCL10 , CCL3 , IL - 6 , TNF - a , IL - 1b , and Type 1 and type II IFNs were found to be significantly elevated in EV71infected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice . After N3 treatment , reduction of proinflammatory mediators release was observed ( Fig . 7 , 8 , 9 ) . Moreover , similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN - c , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , and IL - 13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with PE after administration of IVIG . Beside EV71 , coxsackievirus - induced myocarditis is primarily attributed to viremic injury , and immune infiltration and reclamation [ 34 , 35 ] . Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of coronavirus infection [ 36 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 231}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 360}, "obj": "ne"}]}
