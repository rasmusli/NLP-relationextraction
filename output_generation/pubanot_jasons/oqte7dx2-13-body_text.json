Three recent studies provide crystal structures of the WDR proteins in complex with USP12 and USP46 . USP12 and USP46 were each crystallized bound to WDR48 / UAF1 ( Yin et al . , 2015 ; Dharadhar et al . , 2016 ; Li et al . , 2016 ) , and USP12 was also crystalized in a ternary complex with WDR48 and WDR20 ( Li et al . , 2016 ) . WDR48 and WDR20 bind the DUBs relatively far from the catalytic cleft and stimulate DUB catalytic activity via allosteric mechanisms ( Figure 1 ; Yin et al . , 2015 ; Dharadhar et al . , 2016 ; Li et al . , 2016 ) . USP12 and USP46 exhibit the conserved USP fold structure comprised of Fingers , Palm and Thumb subdomains , with the catalytic triad of cysteine , histidine and aspartic acid , nestled in between the Palm and Thumb FIGURE 1 | Model of USP46 bound to WDR48 and WDR20 . This model is inferred from a combination of structures of USP46 bound to WDR48 and ubiquitin ( Yin et al . , 2015 ) and USP12 bound to WDR48 and WDR20 ( Li et al . , 2016 ) .
