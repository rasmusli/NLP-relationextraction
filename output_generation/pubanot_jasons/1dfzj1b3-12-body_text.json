In the first case , two modes of lipid peroxidation can be used for testing the antioxidant activity : one of them is the autoxidation mode when the process is progressing spontaneously , with self - acceleration due to the accumulation of LOOH ; the other mode is based on the use of the kinetic model of the controlled chain reaction . The utilization of thermo - labile azo - compounds [ water - soluble 2 , 2 ' - azobis ( 2 - amidinopropane ) dihydrochloride ( AAPH ) and lipidsoluble 2 , 2 ' - azobis ( 2 , 4 - dimethylvaleronitrile ) ( AMVN ) ] that decompose and produce active free radicals at moderate temperatures at any desired rate , which can be easily altered and controlled are two good examples greatly used [ 29 ] . When these thermo - labile azo - compounds are not used , and for accelerating lipid oxidation , increased partial oxygen pressure and temperature ; addition of transition metal catalysts ; exposure to light ; and variable shaking and free radical sources may be used [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 523}, "obj": "ne"}]}
