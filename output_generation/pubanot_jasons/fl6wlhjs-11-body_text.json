We use the temperature series as a surrogate measure of the annual influenza season . Also , a patient visit count series is included in the models to account for variations between - EDs ( like ED sizes ) and within - EDs ( day - of - week , for example ) . Addressing the fact that the underlying process is neither \" independent or stationary \" , our interest is to model the underlying \" respiratory - complaint background \" , using the available covariates and significant temporal dependencies present in the data . Without modeling the spatial dependence directly , we investigate whether or not there is evidence of spatial homogeneity in the statistical models across cities . We use filter - based prediction methods to indicate evidence of respiratory - related outbreaks ( e . g . , due to anthrax attack ) using chest radiograph data . We describe the form and function of various filters that are commonly used to detect outbreak signatures . Using a stochastic model for an anthrax attack , we assess the performance of these methods . Since there are no data that contain outbreak patterns , the use of a model is key to providing realistic outbreak patterns that can accurately be used to evaluate these statistical detection methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
