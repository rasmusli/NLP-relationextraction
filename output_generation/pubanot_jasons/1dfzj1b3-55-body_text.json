Such was found [ 44 , 51 ] . The essential oils of Ageratum conyzoides or Amomum tsao ko presented better ability to prevent lipid peroxidation than for scavenging free radicals . Ageratum conyzoides methanolic extracts that had low capacity for preventing lipid oxidation , in the DPPH assay were revealed to be more effective than the essential oil [ 51 ] . On the other hand Lindera pulcherrima , Dodecadenia grandiflora and Dodecadenia gamblei presented the best inhibition of lipid peroxidation determined through the TBARS method as well as in the \u03b2 - carotene bleaching test , but in the DPPH method , only Dodecadenia grandiflora was a powerful DPPH radical scavenger [ 44 ] . Another example was that reported [ 52 ] for Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus oils . In this assay , the authors found that the Thymus vulgaris oil had the best activity against lipid oxidation , whereas in the DPPH method , the authors found that Eugenia caryophyllus oil was the most potent scavenger of DPPH free radicals , even better than the standards ascorbic acid and BHT . The same authors also used the Rancimat test , and in that ase , the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare , although worse than that of the reference BHT . The non - polar fraction and essential oil of Hymenocrater longiflorus possessed great ability to inhibit the bleaching of \u03b2 - carotene , nevertheless the results differed when the DPPH method was used . In this case , the essential oil was the only one that had the worst capacity for scavenging these free radicals [ 47 ] . Independent of the plant part of Myrtus communis var . italica L . used and the antioxidant method used , the methanolic fractions were always better antioxidants than the essential oils [ 46 ] . This is one example in which in both methods the results maintained in contrast to those reported until now .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 190}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 205}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 319}, "obj": "ne"}]}
