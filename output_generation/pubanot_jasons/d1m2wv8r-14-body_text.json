As shown in Fig . 4a , hierarchical clustering of the Felis catus proteins was generated using the DEPs listed in Supplementary Table S1 . The analysis revealed that all replicates clustered tightly . Interestingly , the DAVID software analysis showed that most proteins in a given cluster were enriched for functions involved in similar biological processes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
