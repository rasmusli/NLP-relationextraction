The usefulness of serum procalcitonin measurements has been validated in the diagnosis , severity assessment , and follow - up of patients with lower respiratory tract infections [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . In the current study , the AUC of serum procalcitonin concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia ( AUC = 0 . 705 ) was smaller than those of total WBC ( AUC = 0 . 855 ) and neutrop ( AUC = 0 . 837 ) counts . The combination of BAL fluid WBC counts and serum procalcitonin concentration tended to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ROC model . This indicates that combinations of these markers can be useful to rule - out ( BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $ 0 . 71 ng / mL with a sensitivity of 95 . 8 % and negative likelihood ratio of 0 . 068 ) or rule - in ( BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL and serum C - reactive protein concentration $ 26 . 1 mg / dl with a specificity of 95 . 7 % and positive likelihood ratio of 8 . 63 ) bacterial pneumonia . Diagnostic accuracy could be further improved if BAL fluid cellular profiles are interpreted alongside clinical presentations , radiographic studies , and other relevant test results . Using this approach , it might be possible to identify patients who can be managed without antibacterial agents or those who require antiviral agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 73}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 221}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 439}, "obj": "ne"}]}
