Moreover , earlier studies have advocated that HCV recurrence may be more severe when older donors are used [ 10 , 11 ] . In addition , the type of donor used may have an impact on HCV reinfection of the graft after LT . One clinical observation suggested that HCV recurrence is more severe in living donor LT compared to cadaveric LT [ 12 ] . However , another study reported that there are no differences observed in hepatitis C recurrence rate , severity of intrahepatic pathology , or graft and patient survival between living donor LT and cadaveric LT recipients [ 13 ] . As to the source of HCV reinfection in the allograft , it may occur at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ] . The blood itself has a high probability to be the origin of this allograft reinfection [ 4 ] . It is indeed valuable that identifying these risk factors before LT , particularly when matching donors to HCV recipients , may decrease the incidence of HCV recurrence after LT .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
