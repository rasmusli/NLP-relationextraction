Asp291 in the diplacone and Neu5Ac complexes , which is a mechanistically important acid / base catalyst ( Crennell et al . , 1993 ) , rotates by approximately 120 compared with the apo structure to make a hydrogen bond to the 3 0 - hydroxyl of diplacone or the 4 0 - hydroxyl of Neu5Ac . Moreover , the rotation of Asp291 also induces a conformational change of Ile327 in the apo enzyme compared with both complexes . Relative to the diplaconebound complex , in the Neu5Ac - bound complex Ile327 moves to make a suitable hydrophobic interaction with the - carbon of Asp291 and the 5 0 - acetamide moiety of the Neu5Ac molecule . Apo Cp - NanI CD and the diplacone complex showed a hydrogen - bond interaction mediated by one water molecule ( W1 ) , the position of which nearly overlaps with the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac . On the other hand , the hydrogen bond between Asp328 and the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of The Cp - NanI catalytic site with diplacone . ( a ) Overall structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic domain bound to diplacone . ( b ) Details of the mode of binding . Diplacone and three water molecules ( W1 , W2 and W3 ) are shown as green sticks and red spheres , respectively . Hydrogen bonds are displayed as dashed lines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 765, "end": 776}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 823, "end": 846}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 855, "end": 878}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1018, "end": 1035}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1053}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1307, "end": 1332}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1380, "end": 1407}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
