The order Chiroptera contains more than 1200 species [ 17 ] . Due to this diversity , the information obtained from one species may not apply to others . For instance , in the black flying fox ( Pteropus alecto ) , the interferon gene locus is contracted , whereas in the Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) , this locus is expanded [ 18 , 19 ] . Other examples are discussed later in this review .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
