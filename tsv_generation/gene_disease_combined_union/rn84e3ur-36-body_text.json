According to Eq . ( 2 ) , the infection risk of each passenger after the 3 - hour flight can be calculated for case 1 ~ 3 . For case 2 and 3 , the infection risk is calculated under the assumption that the moving person walks in the airplane frequently during the flight and he / she will walk through the aisle during each cough of the index patient . Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate the average infection risk per passenger in the airplane cabin for case 1 ~ 3 . Figure 8 is the average of the infection risk of the six passengers seated in the same row ( row 1 ~ 12 ) , and Figure 9 is the average of the twelve passengers seated in the same line of seats ( seat A ~ F ) . In Figures 8 and 9 , the calculated infection risk of the index patient is excluded since he is already infected . As shown in Figure 8 , the infection risks of the passengers close to the index patient ( row 8 - 10 ) are much higher than others . Further area has a lower infection risk , except for row 1 and 2 where the moving person stops . From Figure 8 , it also can be seen that the average infection risk of each row is affected by human movement . The movement of the standing person increases the average infection risk in row 6 - 8 ( three rows in front of the index patient ) , row 9 ( the same row of the index patient ) , row 10 ( one row behind the index patient ) and row 1 ( where the moving person stops ) . For other areas , whether the movement can increase the infection risk depends on the moving speed . As shown in Figure 9 , the average infection risk of the passengers in seat B ~ D will increase after human movement . The average infection risk of the passengers in seat A will also increase when the moving speed is 0 . 5 m / s . This result indicates that human movement may influence the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin and lead to increases in the infection risks of more than half of the passengers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1334, "end": 1338}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
