A node is said to be ' captured ' if it is connected to a sampled node but it has not been sampled itself . For all of these schemes , we assume that the total number of nodes N in the network is known . We sample a set S of N S nodes and capture N C nodes , the N S sampled nodes plus their connected non - sampled neighbours . This method will therefore preserve the degree of the initially sampled nodes N S , but for the remaining nodes that are captured , only the edges that link them to the N S nodes will be recorded .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
