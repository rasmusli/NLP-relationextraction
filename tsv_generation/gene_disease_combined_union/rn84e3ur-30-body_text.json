The average lateral positions first increase to 3 . 61 m in 0 . 8 s after the injections and then keep decreasing . Higher moving speeds lead to a slower decreasing rate . In the computational geometry , the index patient was seated at X = 3 . 585 m and the position of the centerline was X = 2 . 29 m . So Figure 2 ( a ) suggest that the airflow induced by human movement will slightly prevent the aerosols from moving across the aisle of the airplane cabin . Figure 2 ( b ) shows that the average longitudinal position keeps increasing after the injections for case 1 ~ 3 . Since the airflow from front to back of the cabin ( longitudinal direction ) is minimal [ 6 , 7 ] , the longitudinal movement of the aerosols of case 1 is mainly due to the initial momentum given by the cough . Figure 2 ( b ) also indicates that human movement may enhance the mixing of room air in the airplane cabin , which may result in the transport of the aerosols along the moving path in both the positive and negative longitudinal direction , not only following the coughing direction or the moving direction . This is also proven by the results of Exposure assessment shown in Section 3 . 3 , in which the aerosol concentrations in the breathing zones of the passengers who are seated ahead and behind the index patient will increase after the movement of the standing person . As shown in Figure 2 ( c ) , the average vertical position of case 1 remains at about 1 . 20 m and starts to fluctuate after 25 s . But for case 2 and 3 , it keeps decreasing and is lower than 0 . 5 m after 40 s . So human movement may cause the suspended aerosols to fall down to the ground and result in a downward transport effect . During human walking , apparent downwash flow and downward contaminant transport can be found in the wake behind the torso of the human body [ 9 ] . Thus the downward transport of the aerosols may be mainly due to flow characteristics of the wake behind the human body . In an airplane cabin , not only the ventilation system but also the wake of a moving human can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols . Higher moving speed may have a stronger downward transport effect .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
