[ 78 ] ) , the majority of in vivo experiments pertaining to virus - bacterial interactions in the URT focus on the role of viruses on the host microbiota . The results of these studies suggest that viruses can alter carriage structure by promoting the colonization of certain commensals . In both animal models and human adults , infection with influenza A virus showed increased colonization by S . pneumoniae and H . influenzae in the URT [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] . Similarly , infecting rats and chinchillas with RSV led to increased colonization by nontypeable H . influenzae [ 84 , 85 ] . Collectively , epidemiologic studies and laboratory experiments suggest that the introduction of a virus to the URT niche can substantially alter the bacterial community present [ 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 63}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 467, "end": 479}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 648, "end": 652}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
