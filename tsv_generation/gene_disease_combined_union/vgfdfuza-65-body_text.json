These challenges present examples where governance structures will need to weigh up the balance between regulation and persuasion as policy approaches . In the Singaporean context , differential policies in the public and private human healthcare sectors , whether by design or practice , are likely to be counterproductive , as patients use both sectors and the occurrence of resistant infections in one sector has implications for the other . On the other hand , the agricultural sector in Singapore is small and the availability of adequate veterinary expertise limited ; imposing tight regulations on antibiotic access in the absence of qualified prescribers is therefore challenging , and persuasive strategies to reduce antibiotic use in this sector are likely to be more realistic , at least in the short term . On their collaborative approach towards governance , many participants highlighted the One Health platform as a good way of bringing stakeholders together . The good relationship between researchers and policymakers was also emphasized via the many avenues for researchers to discuss and share their research findings and discuss policy implications with policymakers . However , there were also conflicts reported specifically between human and animal health experts . This was crystalized on their different takes on what contributes more to AMR . Most physicians believed that antimicrobial use in animal farming as growth promoters might be a more significant driver of AMR , as has been explained by studies [ 28 ] . In contrast , animal health experts believed the animal food industry did not contribute much to the growing resistance when compared to AMR infection rates in the health sector . Finally , governing AMR through the engagement of citizens and civil society was not reported as a strategy in Singapore . However , this is not unique to Singapore , as it is well recognized that globally there has been a lack of engagement of civil society organizations in addressing AMR , especially when comparing and contrasting to the high HIV involvement in the early 90s .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1563, "end": 1567}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1693, "end": 1697}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1878, "end": 1882}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1941, "end": 1945}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 2208, "end": 2212}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
