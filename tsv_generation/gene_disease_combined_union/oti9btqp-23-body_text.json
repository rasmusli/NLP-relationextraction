Currently , there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for this emerging infectious agent . Very recently , a collection of experimental ZIKV vaccines have been shown to lower viral load post challenge in nonpathogenic animal infection models . 21 , 22 These data are encouraging . In this regard , it is important to examine additional novel vaccine approaches targeting ZIKA in additional models that similar to susceptible humans , might show disease . Here we evaluated a synthetic DNA vaccine , designed to express a novel consensus ZIKV - prM and E antigen , for immunogenicity following electroporation - enhanced immunisation in mice and non - human primates . We observed that ZIKV - prME DNA vaccination was immunogenic and generated antigen - specific T cells and binding and neutralising antibodies in both mice and NHPs . Uniquely , the NHPs were immunised with ZIKV - prME through electroporation by the intradermal route , which uses lower voltage and a smaller transfection area than i . m . electroporation , as we have recently described . 23 Further study of such approaches may provide advantages in clinical settings .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 488}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 898, "end": 922}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 63}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
