Previous studies indicated that clearance of WNV in the CNS requires antiviral CD8 + T cells [ 19 , 32 , 55 ] , and that microglia , astrocytes , and neurons express chemokines that attract mononuclear cells to the CNS [ 21 , 56 , 57 ] . To determine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on recruitment of these cells to the CNS , leukocytes isolated from the cortices of WNV - NS5 - E218A - infected ( See figure on previous page . ) Fig . 3 CSF1R antagonism increases mortality and CNS viral burdens during i . c . infection with WNV - NS5 - E218A . Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks , infected i . c . with WNV - NS5 - E218A at 10 4 PFU , then monitored for a mortality and b weight loss for up to 25 dpi . a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control as calculated by log - rank ( Mantel - Cox ) test . b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness . After death , the last measured weight was carried through to the end of the experiment . Significantly greater weight loss was measured in PLX5622 - treated mice compared with controls as calculated by two - way ANOVA with matched values comparing group means without multiple comparisons . For a and b , data represent the compilation of two independent experiments with 10 mice per group . c At 8 dpi , cortical brain tissue was extracted and relative transcript levels in tissue homogenates were measured by SYBR qRT - PCR for indicated cytokines . Data for individual mice were normalized to Gapdh . Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM of three to five mice from one experiment . Statistical significance between treatment groups for each cytokine was calculated by t test . d - j Tissue viral loads were measured by plaque assay at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi in control ( black ) or PLX5 - treated ( red ) mice . k Serum viral loads as measured by qRT - PCR . d - k Data are presented as scatter plots with each mouse represented by a dot with the mean indicated by a line . For d - k , data represent the compilation of two - independent experiments with 10 mice per group . Dotted lines in d - k indicate assay limit of detection . l - o Representative confocal microscopic images of Tunel ( red ) , NeuN ( green ) , and DAPI ( blue ) of hippocampus ( l , m ) and cerebellum ( n , o ) of control - ( l , n ) or PLX5622 - treated ( m , o ) mice infected i . c . with WNV - NS5 - E218A at 6 dpi . Arrow heads point to DAPI - positive nuclei positive for both Tunel and NeuN . Asterisks denote DAPI - and Tunel - positive but NeuN - negative nuclei . p Quantification of confocal microscopic images for number of DAPI - positive nuclei positive for Tunel and NeuN in the hippocampus ( Hpc ) , cerebellum ( Cb ) , and brainstem ( Bs ) . The number of Tunel + NeuN + nuclei per high - power field ( HPF ) was quantified from three to six images captured at \u00d7 40 per brain region across two separate brain sections for each of five independent mice collected in one experiment . Each symbol represents the average number for an individual mouse , with bar indicating mean \u00b1 SEM . Statistical significance was calculated using two - way ANOVA with Sidak ' s multiple comparisons test . For all data : ns , not significant at P < 0 . 05 ; * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 mice were assessed by flow cytometry at 8 dpi . As expected , CD45 lo CD11b + ( P1 ) population , which is primarily microglia [ 58 ] , remained significantly depleted in the PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig . 6a - c ) . The population of CD45 hi CD11b + ( P2 ) , which is primarily infiltrating monocytes / macrophages [ 58 ] , were non - significantly reduced in the PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice . However , the number of CD45 hi CD11b neg ( P3 ) lymphocyte population [ 58 ] were non - significantly elevated in PLX5622 - treated compared with control mice , though the percentage of this population was significantly elevated ( Fig . 6a - c ) . This increase was largely due to elevated numbers of CD8 + T cell infiltration in PLX5622 - treated mice ( Fig . 6d - f ) . Though there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD8 + T cells specific for the WNV immunodominant peptide between PLX5622 and control - treated mice , there were significantly more WNV - specific CD8 + T cells isolated from PLX5622 compared with control - treated cortex ( Fig . 6g - i ) . Despite the increased infiltration of WNV - specific CD8 + T cells in PLX5622 - treated mice , the percentages of cells expressing early activation marker CD69 and their level of expression were significantly reduced in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig . 6j - m ) . Additionally , the percentage of WNV - specific CD8 + T cells positive for CD160 as well as the level of CD160 expression , which is specifically expressed on highly activated CD8 + T cells [ 59 ] , were reduced in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice . However , the numbers of NS4B + CD8 + cells positive for either CD69 or CD160 were non - significantly elevated in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated cortices ( Fig . 6l , p ) due to the increased numbers of NS4B + CD8 + cells . Because numbers of infiltrating WNV - specific CD8 + T cells derived from the CNS of PLX5622 - treated animals were increased , we hypothesized that their lack of local reactivation may be the result of loss of co - stimulatory signals and / or inflammatory cytokines ( Fig . 3c ) in the CNS . In order to distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating monocytes / macrophages , CNS myeloid cells were examined for expression of the microglia - specific marker P2RY12 ( Fig . 7a ) . Infiltrating monocytes / macrophages were then identified via gating of P2RY12 neg CD11b + cells ( Fig . 7b ) . Populations of both CNS - derived P2RY12 + CD45 + microglia ( P1 , Fig . 7a ) and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + monocytes / macrophages ( P2 , Fig . 7b ) were reduced in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig . 7i , j ) . While no differences in the overall number of cells expressing MHCII were observed in P2RY12 + CD45 + , a significant reduction of MHCII + CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + was seen ( Fig . 7c , d , l ) . This corresponded with a relative increase in the percentage of MHCII + cells in both P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + populations due to the decreased numbers of total P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells in the cortices of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice ( Fig . 7k ) . However , the numbers of P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing B7 co - stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86 were significantly reduced in the CNS of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated animals ( Fig . 7e - h , m - p ) . The percentage of remaining P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing CD80 or CD86 were not reduced ( Fig . 7m , o ) ; however , the percentage of remaining CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells expressing CD86 was significantly reduced ( Fig . 7o ) , similar to results seen in peripheral APCs ( Figs . 4 , 5 ) Together , these data suggest that resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages are important sources of CD80 and CD86 in the CNS , and PLX5622 treatment depletes these cellular sources of co - stimulatory molecules .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1676, "end": 1686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1732, "end": 1738}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1876, "end": 1885}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
