The first part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in methanolic extracts of different parts of H . littoralis , namely , root , bulb , stem , leaves , flower , and anther . The second part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in callus extracts produced by using different combinations and concentrations of plant growth regulators ( PGRs ) . Sample preparation for HPLC analysis was carried out by accurately weighing 2 mg of each dried extract , which was then dissolved in 2 mL of HPLC - grade methanol to give a concentration of 1 mg / mL . These samples were then filtered through a 0 . 45 m syringe filter ( Whatman , Maidstone , England ) and kept in fridge at \u2212 20 \u2218 C prior to HPLC analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
