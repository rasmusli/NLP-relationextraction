In these birds , we noticed that the ovaries were productive , but in the lumen of the oviducts , there were abortive , defective eggs , mucous and fibrinous clots . In particular , according to both virological and histopathological data , the most affected section was the infundibulum , and in 29 % of the birds in the first 4 - 6 days pi , the mucosal epithelium was extensively ulcerated and immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse positivity in the remaining epithelial cells . On the other hand , despite the evidence of viral replication in the remaining parts of the oviduct , the degree of inflammation was generally lower in the magnum , and practically absent at the level of the uterus . Interestingly , the proportion of animals with an H9N2 infection in the oviduct ( 62 % ) closely translated into a proportional drop in egg production during the first 2 weeks post infection , as the average number of laid eggs per day decreased from approximately 10 . 00 to 4 . 43 eggs / group , suggesting that the acute and subacute inflammation of the organ , in particular at the level of infundibulum , impaired the oviposition in each of the infected hens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 787}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1069, "end": 1082}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
