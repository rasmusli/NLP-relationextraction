{"cord_uid": "56fc398e", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4455802", "divid": "30", "text": "For outbreaks seeded in Cumbria and simulated on the full dataset , we obtain a final mean epidemic size of 185 farms , with a mean duration of 22 weeks and a mean peak size of 45 farms ( figure 2 ; electronic supplementary material , figure S8 ) . The mean epidemic sizes after 6 and 12 weeks were 23 and 64 farms , respectively . For all node sampling methods without rescaling , the epidemic size is under - predicted as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases ( figure 2 ) . After six weeks , S min \u00bc 3 % for the TNS method , 20 % for the SBS method and 80 % for the RNS method . After 12 weeks , the percentage of nodes that must be sampled increases to 9 % , 30 % and 90 % for the TNS , SBS and RNS methods , respectively ( figure 2b ) . In order for these methods to accurately predict the full epidemic , 14 % , 40 % and 90 % of the nodes must be sampled for the TNS , SBS and RNS methods , respectively ( figure 2c ) . For the RMS method , S min \u00bc 30 % for 6 weeks , 50 % for 12 weeks and 80 % for the whole epidemic . Contour plots for epidemic size predictions for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria for each week of the outbreak ( from week 1 to the end of the epidemic ) are shown in electronic supplementary material , figures S8 - S11 . All methods provide accurate predictions of the size of the epidemic in the first few weeks . However , for longer durations , the TNS and the SBS methods provide the most robust predictions of epidemic size over time . Similar behaviour is observed for model predictions of epidemic duration and epidemic peak size ( electronic supplementary material , figures S8 - S11b , c ) - the TNS method is able to accurately capture these characteristics when only 15 % of the nodes are sampled , compared with 30 % , 80 % and 90 % for the SBS , RMS and RNS methods , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
