However , the difference in detection rates of HRV between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases did not generate a significant P - value ( P = 0 . 404 ) . For adenovirus , the rate of pathogen detection was higher in asymptomatic specimens ( 10 % ) than that of in symptomatic specimens ( 7 % ) , although the difference in detection rate between these two categories of specimens was not statistically significant . Similarly , for HMPV and S . pneumoniae , the difference in detection rate between the symptomatic and asymptomatic attacks were not significant ( P = 0 . 219 and P = 1 . 00 , respectively ) . On the other hand , RSV detection rate was significantly higher in symptomatic specimens than asymptomatic specimen ( P = 0 . 004 ) , suggesting the potential involvement of RSV in ARI illness . Finally , multiple pathogens were detected in only 7 % ( 2 / 30 ) of asymptomatic specimens and this detection rate was significantly lower than the detection rate of multiple pathogens in symptomatic specimens ( 36 % , P = 0 . 0007 ) , implying possible pathogenic role of multiple pathogens in ARI symptoms . It is mentionable here that we couldn ' t detect any other bacteria other than two isolates of S . pneumoniae in 30 asymptomatic cases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 904}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1202, "end": 1206}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
