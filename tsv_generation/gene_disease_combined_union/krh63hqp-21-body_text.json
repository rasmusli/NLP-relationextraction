When we shifted the \" frozen \" samples back 21 years ( i . e . , sequences from 1976 were assigned a recalibrated date of 1955 ) , we see the data lines up almost perfectly ( r 2 = 0 . 989 ; mutation rate = 14 . 4 ) . The exact amount of time - frame adjustment was not critical ; adjustments ranging from 20 to 30 years all gave excellent alignments , with correlation coefficients above 98 % . The observed accumulation rate of roughly 14 mutations per year ( 1 . 1 \u00d7 10 - 3 mutations per site per year ) is more or less consistent with previous estimates ( e . g . , [ 39 , 57 ] ) . The accumulation of non - synonymous mutations in human H1N1 genomes is also shown in Figure 3 . The non - synonymous mutations are not as abundant , as expected , but they are still accumulating at a rapid and constant rate . There were an average of 2 . 4 amino acid changes per year ( 0 . 6 \u00d7 10 - 3 mutations per codon per year ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 801, "end": 820}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
