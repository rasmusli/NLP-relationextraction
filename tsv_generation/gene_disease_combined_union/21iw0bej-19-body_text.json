RD cells were infected with EV - D68 Fermon stain at an MOI of 0 . 8 , and the cells were collected for cell cycle distribution analysis after 24 h . An obvious increase in the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 was observed in EV - D68 - infected cells ( 45 . 20 \u00b1 0 . 14 % ) as compared to mock - infected cells ( 36 . 50 \u00b1 0 . 76 % ) ( 23 . 84 % increase ; P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 2A ) . Therefore , EV - D68 itself can manipulate the host cell to accumulate preferentially at G0 / G1 phase rather than at G2 / M , which favors viral production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 206}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
