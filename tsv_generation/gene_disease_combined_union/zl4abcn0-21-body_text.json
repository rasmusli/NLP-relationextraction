The mobile phases were acetonitrile - deionised distilled water ( ddH 2 O ) at ratios of 40 : 60 v / v , 35 : 75 v / v , 30 : 70 v / v , 25 : 75 v / v , 20 : 80 v / v , and 15 : 85 v / v , each at a flow rate of 1 mL / min . All these mobile phases resulted in peak splitting and tailing . The retention time was longer than 5 min . This phenomenon may be due to the ionization of the compound in the column .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
