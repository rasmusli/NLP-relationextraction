There has been significant success in prediction of pseudoknot - free secondary structures ( structures with no crossing base pairs ) [ 23 , 25 , 26 ] . While many small RNA secondary structures are pseudoknot - free , many biologically important RNA molecules , both in the cell [ 27 , 28 ] , and in viral RNA [ 29 ] are found to be pseudoknotted .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 467}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 554}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 604}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
