In this study , birds were only swabbed in the trachea once , on day 4 pi to ensure infection was ongoing . We kept handling to a minimum , to avoid disturbance of the animals and the interference of confounding factors in the assessment of laying performances . Eggs were collected , counted and evaluated in terms of shape , color and shell thickness using an analog micrometer with a sensitivity of 0 . 01 mm ( Baxlo \u00ae Precision , Spain ) . All of the birds were euthanized on day 80 pi to collect the oviduct and evaluate the histological architecture of the organ .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
