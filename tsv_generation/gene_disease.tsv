0	Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human @DISEASE$ H3N2	1
1	To identify air transportation communities , we approximate a maximal - modularity subdivision of the 1 , 227 - largest - airport network by employing a recently described stochastic Monte - Carlo approach [ 18 ]	1
2	Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non - overlapping groups ; for a definition we refer to [ 19 ]	1
3	For any given partition , modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low	1
4	For large networks , a variety of methods have been introduced to approximate their optimal subdivision	1
5	The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition	1
6	For further details we refer to [ 18 , 20 ] and in Text S1 we describe how we incorporate subdivision uncertainty in our phylogeographic approach .	1
7	We employ a novel approach to simultaneously reconstruct spatiotemporal history and test the contribution of potential predictors of spatial spread	1
8	The approach extends a recently developed Bayesian method of phylogeographic inference [ 21 ] into a generalized linear model ( GLM ) , by parameterizing each rate of among - location movement in the phylogeographic model as a log linear function of various potential predictors	1
9	For each predictor j , the GLM parameterization includes a coefficient @GENE$ , which quantifies the contribution or effect size of the predictor ( in log space ) , and a @GENE$ d j , that allows the predictor to be included or excluded from the model	1
10	We estimate the d variables using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection ( BSSVS ) [ 22 , 23 ] , resulting in an estimate of the posterior inclusion probability or support for each predictor	1
11	This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes from a pre - defined set of predictors that can explain the phylogenetic history of among - location movement while simultaneously	1
12	What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens ? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread , but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors , such as human mobility and demography	1
13	Here , we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human @DISEASE$ dynamics	1
14	We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration , whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales	1
15	We demonstrate the power of our inter - disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of @DISEASE$ in 2009	1
16	Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of @DISEASE$ .	1
17	reconstructing the ancestral locations in the evolutionary history	1
18	In Text S1 , we ( i ) provide more mathematical detail of the GLM model , ( ii ) describe novel transition kernels for efficient statistical inference , ( iii ) propose prior specifications and ( iv ) explain how Bayes factors can be calculated for each predictor based on d estimates	1
19	The method introduced here is implemented in the BEAST software package [ 24 ] .	1
20	The GLM approach offers many statistical advantages over other approaches [ 25 ] in efficiently testing spatial hypotheses ( see Text S1 for a detailed comparative analysis )	1
21	Commonlyused Bayesian measures of model fit ( such as marginal likelihood estimation using the harmonic mean ) , which can be applied to models with among - location movement rates fixed to a particular predictor , have been shown to perform poorly [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ]	1
22	Although more accurate alternatives have recently been proposed [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] , they are computationally prohibitive on large data sets such as those studied here	1
23	Importantly , the previous approach provides only a relative ranking of different models and , unlike the GLM model , cannot identify which of the top - ranked predictors need to be jointly considered as explanatory variables	1
24	A further advantage of the GLM approach is that in addition to providing a measure of support for each predictor , it can also quantify the contribution or effect size of each predictor by estimating the associated coefficients ( b ) .	1
25	For the spread of @DISEASE$ , we consider several potential predictors of global migration , including different logtransformed measures of geographical distance , absolute latitude , air transportation data , demographic and economic data , viral surveillance data , antigenic evolution and sequence sample sizes ( described in more detail in Text S1 )	1
26	Text S1 also reports the evolutionary and demographic models used in BEAST and describes how phylogenetic uncertainty is approximated during phylogeographic inference .	1
27	Phylogeographic movement events among locations are modeled by a continuous - time Markov chain ( CTMC ) process along each branch of the viral phylogeny	1
28	Although both the transitions among locations ( Markov jumps ) and the waiting times between transitions ( Markov rewards ) are not directly observed , posterior expectations of these values can be efficiently computed [ 29 , 30 ]	1
29	Here , we implement posterior inference of the complete Markov jump history through time in BEAST and use these estimates to assess the source - sink dynamics of @DISEASE$ and to evaluate the predictive performance of phylogeographic models .	1
30	To compare the performance of different migration rate models in predicting global pandemic spread , we simulate a stochastic meta - population susceptible - infected - recovered ( SIR ) model with n = 14 populations , matching the 14 air communities analyzed in the phylogeographic model	1
31	The model tracks the number of susceptible ( S ) , infected ( I ) and recovered ( R ) individuals in each population each day of the simulation	1
32	The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [ 31 ]	1
33	Infection spreads through mass - action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters	1
34	Population - specific host population size is equal to human population size ( Text S1 )	1
35	Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1 : the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [ 31 ] and the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1	1
36	3 [ 31 ]	1
37	This results in a transmission rate b ~ 0 : 433	1
38	Although estimates of R 0 for @DISEASE$ vary across studies , the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations	1
39	Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j ~ P n i ~ 1 r ij bI i S j = N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within - population contacts and r jj ~ 1	1
40	Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates , so that r ij ~ c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data	1
41	Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations ( see below )	1
42	This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model , despite their different scales	1
43	Compartments are updated according to a t - leaping algorithm [ 32 ] with one - day intervals .	1
44	Migration rates between populations in the SIR model are defined according to four scenarios , as follows : ( A ) equal rates , ( B ) rates proportional to the amount of air travel occurring between them ( in terms of the number of passengers moving from one population to another ) , ( C ) rates proportional to Markov jump estimates based on a standard phylogeographic model ( undertaken with and without BSSVS to reduce the number of rate parameters ) and ( D ) a GLM model that only considers air travel as a predictor	1
45	To compare the spread of @DISEASE$ under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic spread , we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak times ( across 100 simulations ) and the observed peak times for all locations except Mexico ( based on World Health Organization data ; Text S1 )	1
46	Correspondence was measured using the Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient , and tested with associated p - values obtained using a permutation test ( Text S1 ) , as well as using the mean average error ( MAE ; in days )	1
47	We consider the @GENE$ ' s rank correlation coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they are more robust to outliers , which are clearly present in the observed peaks	1
48	Therefore , the scaling of between - population coupling c for the various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize Spearman ' s rank correlation .	1
49	To identify key factors in the seasonal dispersal of human @DISEASE$ viruses , we use a Bayesian model selection procedure to estimate the phylogeographic history of H3N2 viruses sampled worldwide between 2002 and 2007 ( Text S1 ) , while concurrently evaluating the contribution of several potential predictors of spatial spread	1
50	In addition to considering two geographic discretizations of the available data , we also identify community structure in global air travel by determining partitions with high intracommunity connectivity and low inter - community connectivity ( Methods )	1
51	Although this approach is blind to the airports ' geographic locations , the 14 resulting global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions ( Fig	1
52	1 )	1
53	We find air communities that are largely specific to Oceania , China , Japan , Sub - Saharan Africa , Mexico and Canada	1
54	Madagascar , Réunion and some Caribbean destinations are examples of exceptions that are , as non - European locations , connected to a @GENE$ .	1
55	Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$	1
56	Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone	1
57	Evolutionary analyses of @GENE$ increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of @DISEASE$ viruses , but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility , mainly because no statistical framework exists within which @GENE$ and empirical data on host movement can be combined	1
58	Here , we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human @DISEASE$ subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human @DISEASE$ worldwide	1
59	Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human @DISEASE$ while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread , we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows , whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance	1
60	Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global @DISEASE$ diversity	1
61	By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009 , we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated	1
62	In conclusion , the global dynamics of @DISEASE$ are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled @GENE$	1
63	The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control .	1
64	Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global @DISEASE$ virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement , specifically , geographical proximity , demography and economic measures , antigenic divergence , epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support ( Fig	1
65	2 )	1
66	Instead , we find consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant driver of the global dissemination of @DISEASE$ viruses	1
67	This is reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable ( * 1 on a log scale ) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the model ( posterior probability	1
68	0	1
69	93 and Bayes factor	1
70	760 )	1
71	This effect size means that viral lineage movement rates are about 15 times higher for connections with the highest passenger flow compared to connections with the lowest flow , controlling for all other predictors	1
72	The result is robust when we repeat the analysis ( i ) using different partitions of sampling locations ( air communities and different geographic partitions , Fig	1
73	2 ) , ( ii ) using different sequence sub - samples for the air communities ( Fig	1
74	S1 ) , ( iii ) using the full data set or a small but more balanced number of sub - samples ( Fig	1
75	S2 ) , and ( iv ) using a more liberal prior specification on predictor inclusion ( Fig	1
76	S3 )	1
77	We down - sampled particular air communities or geographic regions relative to their population sizes ( Text S1 ) , which still leaves considerable heterogeneity in sample sizes , explaining why they are included as an explanatory variable in the GLM model	1
78	Our aim is not to demonstrate a role for sample sizes in phylogeography , but by explicitly including them as predictive variables , we raise the credibility that other predictors are not included in the model because of sampling bias	1
79	We note that the sample size predictors may in fact absorb some of the effect of air travel because a GLM model that only considers passenger flux as a predictor of H3N2 movement among the air communities results in a higher mean effect of size of about 1	1
80	5 .	1
81	To also explore spatial dynamics at smaller scales , we further partition large geographical regions that are administratively coherent , such as the USA , China , Japan and Australia , resulting in 26 global sampling regions ( Text S1 )	1
82	In this analysis , air travel again predicts viral movement ( posterior probability	1
83	0	1
84	99 and Bayes factor	1
85	18000 ) , but the movement is also inversely associated with geographical distance between locations ( posterior probability = 0	1
86	76 and Bayes factor = 87 ) , and , less intuitively , with origin and destination population densities ( although the size of the latter effects are weaker , Fig	1
87	2 )	1
88	The negative association of population density with viral movement may suggest that commuting is less likely , per capita , to occur out of , or into , dense subpopulations .	1
89	Although not the main focus of the current study , our integrated approach also provides phylogeographic reconstructions that offer insights into the global source - sink dynamics of human @DISEASE$	1
90	The trunk or backbone of phylogenies reconstructed from temporally - sampled @GENE$ ( Fig	1
91	3 ) represents the lineage that successfully persists from one epidemic year to the next [ 14 , 33 ]	1
92	We determine the spatial history of this lineage using Markov rewards in the posterior tree distribution , thereby estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of the trunk lineage from 2002 to 2006 ( Fig	1
93	3 )	1
94	These estimates provide strong support for mainland China as the principal H3N2 source population , occupying close to 60 % of the trunk time in the H3N2 phylogenies ( Fig	1
95	3 ) , followed by Southeast Asia , which comprises about 15 % of the trunk time	1
96	We further examine temporal heterogeneity in the source - sink process by combining a summary of the estimated trunk location through time together with an phylogenetic summary in Fig	1
97	3 impact of temporal sampling heterogeneity on these estimates because the Southeast Asian trunk dominance precedes a period of higher sampling availability for Southeast Asia relative to mainland China ( Fig	1
98	3 )	1
99	The important role of mainland China in seeding the global seasonal spread of human @DISEASE$ results in a high net migration out of this air community ( Fig	1
100	S4 )	1
101	However , air communities that do not contribute significantly to the trunk can also maintain high net outflow , in particular the USA , which may be seeded by relatively few introductions each year whilst exporting comparatively more viruses to other locations during the epidemic season .	1
102	In order to assess the extent to which evolutionary analyses such as ours benefit from integrating host mobility data , we examine their predictive performance by using them to predict the relative timing of the geographic spread of the @DISEASE$ variant that emerged in 2009	1
103	We conduct simulations of the spread of a novel pathogen out of Mexico using an SIR model whose transmission parameters are informed by epidemiological estimates obtained for pandemic H1N1 [ 31 ] and whose spatial spread is determined by one of four different migration rate models , each defined by a different matrix of movement rates among all pairs of locations ( Methods )	1
104	We measure the relative correspondence between the simulated and observed H1N1 peaks for each location except Mexico using a Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient ( r ) and mean absolute error ( MAE ; in days ) ( Fig	1
105	4 )	1
106	An equal rates model ( A ) , which does not express any migration rate preference , results in a weak match ( r ~ 0 : 11 , P = 0	1
107	73 , MAE = 40	1
108	9 days ) between the simulations and the observed spatial spread of H1N1 ( Fig	1
109	4 ) , indicating that the population sizes included in the @GENE$ for each region offer limited predictive performance	1
110	As expected , adding information on the number of airline passengers ( model B ) yields a large improvement in correspondence between simulations and observations ( r ~ 0 : 61 , P = 0	1
111	03 , MAE = 35	1
112	8 days )	1
113	In contrast , a standard parameterrich phylogeographic model that is only informed by sequence data and not air traffic information ( model C ) yields only part of this improvement in predictive performance ( r ~ 0 : 47 , P = 0	1
114	10 , MAE = 39	1
115	4 days )	1
116	However , if inference under model C is made more efficient by focusing on a small set of parameters ( using BSSVS , [ 21 ] ; see Methods ) then phylogeographic estimates yield a predictive performance ( r ~ 0 : 62 , P = 0	1
117	02 , MAE = 36	1
118	4 days , Fig	1
119	S5 ) that is close to that of the air travel model ( B )	1
120	Finally , The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor	1
121	Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots	1
122	The contribution of each predictor , when included in the model ( bDd ~ 1 ) , where b is the coefficient or effect size , is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale	1
123	NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the predictor was never included in the model	1
124	We tested different population size and density measures , different incidence - based measures and different seasonal measures ( Text S1 ) , but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity	1
125	The estimates for the full set of predictors are summarized for each sub - sampled data set in Fig	1
126	S5	1
127	NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data	1

133	01 , MAE = 32	1
134	3 ) , suggesting that global influenza transmission is best predicted by combining passenger flux data with the information on viral lineage movement contained in sequence data	1
135	The simulations generally correspond better with observed H1N1 peaks during the initial period of pandemic expansion , while the epidemic peaks for Russia and Africa occur significantly earlier in the simulations than in reality	1
136	This is likely due to the multi - peaked character of the regional epidemics ( Text S1 ) ; the H1N1 virus spreads to most of the world during the first pandemic wave , whereas regions like Russia and Africa appeared to miss the first wave entirely	1
137	Seasonal effects that are unaccounted for by our simulation may at least partly explain the outliers , but they affect the models we aim to compare in a very similar way	1
138	Because of the outliers , we consider the non - parametric Spearman ' s r to be a more appropriate measure of correspondence than the MAE , but they are consistent in their model ranking	1
139	We note that absolute prediction errors can be considerably improved by only considering the 9 air communities that peaked prior to September , 2009 , which returns a MAE of 11	1
140	2 day for the GLM model	1
141	However , because of the difficulties in establishing initial waves and their peaks , and the uncertainty in our epidemiological model , we caution against more detailed interpretation of these simulations beyond the general trends we extract here .	1
142	The prevention and control of @DISEASE$ at the global scale relies critically on our understanding of its mode of geographical dissemination	1
143	Here , we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide	1
144	Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global @DISEASE$ spread , an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies ( e	1
145	g	1
146	[ 5 ] ) , but has , until now , remained difficult to obtain from empirical data	1
147	The dominant predictors of @DISEASE$ spread will undoubtedly be scale - dependent , as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas ( Fig	1
148	2 ) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel , such as workplace commuting [ 9 ]	1
149	This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales , where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious , provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available	1
150	One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of @GENE$ worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location , which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes	1
151	More representative sampling across the globe , or within a more geographically confined area of interest , will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures	1
152	In particular , if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [ 34 ]	1
153	In addition , many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution , for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin - destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes .	1
154	Due to the difficulties associated with geographic partitioning , we used algorithms to optimally define communities in the global air transportation network as an alternative strategy to specify phylogeographic states , and subsequently show that our GLM results are robust to the different partitions used	1
155	Because air travel is a consistent and highly supported explanatory variable for global influenza dispersal , communities within the air transportation network are likely to provide the most appropriate spatial structuring of our data	1
156	However , in addition to the partitioning itself , further research is also needed to select the appropriate number of samples from the resulting regions to improve on ad hoc down - sampling based on population size .	1
157	Although identifying the causes of pathogen spread is of great importance in spatial epidemiology , integrating this information in evolutionary models also offers major advantages for phylogeographic reconstructions and their relevance to @DISEASE$ surveillance and pandemic preparedness	1
158	By capturing a more realistic process of spatial spread , our novel approach results in more credible reconstructions of spatial evolutionary history , which may shed further light on the persistence and migration dynamics of human influenza viruses	1
159	Because of the importance of influenza dynamics for vaccine strain selection , different phylogeographic reconstructions have attempted to characterize the global population structure of the virus and have arrived at somewhat mixed findings [ 3 , 14 , 17 ]	1
160	This may be explained by the use of both different sampling and different methodology	1
161	The data and methods used here corroborate the explorations of antigenic and genetic divergence by [ 3 ] and demonstrate the prominence of mainland China and Southeast Asia as locations of trunk lineage persistence	1
162	Our findings are however based on roughly the same genetic data , and our approach of inferring the spatial history of the trunk lineage through Markov reward estimates may be viewed as the more direct , statistical equivalent of measuring strain location distance from the trunk [ 3 ]	1
163	Although we find a strong signal for the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and Southeast Asia , our analysis is restricted to the period 2002 to 2006 , and thus we make no conclusions about the location of the trunk lineage outside of this period	1
164	The degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal influenza and its heterogeneity among different influenza variants has yet to be determined and requires datasets of longer duration	1
165	Moreover , we suggest that analyses of future data sets that are more comprehensively sampled through time will also benefit from phylogeographic models that can accommodate temporal heterogeneity in movement rates	1
166	Such models may also improve the performance of some explanatory variables	1
167	For example , in the analysis presented here , we do not consider the absence of support for seasonality as a predictor in our GLM model as evidence against seasonality in H3N2 spread	1
168	Rather , it simply reflects the difficulty in incorporating seasonality into a time - homogeneous model of lineage movement	1
169	Developments are now underway to appropriately accommodate heterogeneity in spatial spread through time .	1
170	By using models to predict the observed global emergence of @DISEASE$ , we demonstrate that an approach that integrates passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information	1
171	Although the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large , it remains remarkable because we attempt to predict the spatial expansion of an epidemic lineage ( pandemic H1N1 ) from the seasonal dynamics of another lineage ( H3N2 ) and because the main process underlying the global dispersal of @DISEASE$ appears to be air travel itself	1
172	Passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric , thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread , which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of @DISEASE$	1
173	Investigations using more advanced simulation techniques , e	1
174	g	1
175	[ 35 ] , may be able to build upon the conceptual bridge between genetic data and epidemiological modeling implied by our findings	1
176	Future prediction efforts may also need to focus on alternative scenarios of spatial spread , as highlighted by the recent emergence of a novel @DISEASE$ lineage in China [ 36 ]	1
177	Should this virus evolve sustained human - to - human transmissibility , then airline - passenger data and flight routes from the outbreak regions in particular , would be able to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk	1
178	If the virus remains restricted to avian hosts , however , risk maps for the transmission of @DISEASE$ ( perhaps based on predictors calibrated against H5N1 avian influenza ) may help to target H7N9 surveillance and control efforts	1
179	In conclusion , our framework is applicable to different @DISEASE$ and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity .	1

233	The emergence and worldwide dispersal of novel human pathogens is increasingly challenging global public health [ 1 ] .	1
234	Notable recent examples include novel @DISEASE$ strains , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ aureus , which all exploit today ' s complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world	1
235	In the context of human @DISEASE$ , the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [ 2 ]	1
236	Air travel likely drives the global circulation of @DISEASE$ [ 3 ] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally - persistent strains between epidemic seasons	1
237	Retrospective modeling of the ' Hong Kong flu ' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [ 4 ]	1
238	Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on @DISEASE$ virus spread , e	1
239	g	1
240	[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] , but few have attempted to verify such models against underlying empirical data on human movement patterns [ 9 ] .	1
241	Two studies on the timing and rate of seasonal influenza transmission across the United States of America ( USA ) highlight the difficulty of using standard epidemiological data to disentangle the relative contributions of different human transportation systems to @DISEASE$ spread	1
242	Using weekly time series of excess mortality due to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( P & I ) , Viboud et al	1
243	[ 9 ] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence of outbreaks across the continental USA are most strongly associated with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces , and to a lesser extent with the distance between locations and various measures of domestic transportation	1
244	In contrast , Brownstein et al	1
245	[ 10 ] concluded that the rate of inter - regional spread and timing of @DISEASE$ in the USA , as measured using weekly P & I mortality statistics , is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November	1
246	These discordant findings generated significant debate [ 11 ] , especially in the context of a potential pandemic of pathogenic influenza [ 12 ] , which would require rapid decisions to be made on the implementation of travel restrictions .	1
247	As a historical record of epidemic spread , viral genetic sequence data may offer a valuable source of information for the empirical verification of epidemiological models	1
248	Several studies have demonstrated their utility and power , for example by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [ 13 ] and the spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [ 3 , 14 ]	1
249	More generally , it is recognized that the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza should be analysed in a framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics [ 15 ]	1
250	Current attempts to reconstruct viral spread through time and space from genetic data , however , typically fit parameter - rich models to sparse spatial data and result in phylogeographic patterns that are difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological processes [ 16 ]	1
251	Together with potential sampling bias , this complicates phylogeographic tasks , such as the characterization of source - sink dynamics in @DISEASE$	1
252	It is therefore unsurprising that different studies on the global circulation of H3N2 are sometimes inconsistent [ 3 , 14 , 17 ] , despite the importance of such work for influenza surveillance and vaccine strain selection .	1
253	Here we use a model - based approach to explicitly tests spatial epidemiological hypotheses by integrating empirical data on human movement patterns with viral genetic data	1
254	This framework enables us to measure the relative contribution of different predictive variables to viral spatial spread	1
255	We apply this approach to seasonal H3N2 dynamics and use it to identify key drivers of the global dissemination of @DISEASE$	1
256	Analysis of different sampling schemes , including one that represents the community structure in global air transportation , provides consistent support for air travel governing the spatial dynamics of seasonal H3N2 infections	1
257	Using epidemiological simulations , we further demonstrate that estimates resulting from the merger of human air travel and H3N2 influenza genetics best capture the observed global expansion of @DISEASE$ in 2009 .	1
258	We complemented a previously collected @GENE$ sequence data set , comprising 1 , 441 sequences sampled globally from 2002 to 2007 [ 3 ] , with publicly available sequences sampled within the same time interval	1
259	The allocation of the sequence data into 15 and 26 geographic regions as well as into 14 air communities is described in detail in Supporting information Text S1 .	1
260	The worldwide air transportation network is defined by a passenger flux matrix that quantifies the number of passengers traveling between each pair of airports	1
261	We use a dataset provided by OAG ( Official Airline Guide ) Ltd	1
262	( http : / / www	1
263	oag	1
264	com ) , containing 4 , 092 airports and the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights between pairs of airports during the years 2004 - 2006	1
265	We take the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights from airport i to j to be proportional to the number of passengers traveling .	1
266	New Insights in Recurrent @DISEASE$ Infection after Liver Transplantation	1
267	The influence of HCV genotypes on @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT had been assessed , but the results were still controversial	1
268	Some studies demonstrated that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for @DISEASE$ after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes [ 7 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
269	Another study by Gayowski et al	1
270	reported in their results that the rate of recurrent @DISEASE$ , timing to recurrence , severity of recurrence and response to @GENE$ therapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post - LT @DISEASE$ [ 22 ] .	1
271	Recently , genetic variation in the region of the @GENE$ on @GENE$ , coding for @GENE$ , has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with @DISEASE$ in patients with genotype 1 @DISEASE$ who are treated with @GENE$ plus RBV in the nontransplant setting [ 23 , 24 ]	1
272	@GENE$ polymorphism has also been associated with spontaneous @DISEASE$ clearance [ 25 ]	1
273	One cohort study , Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 which included 189 consecutive @DISEASE$ patients undergoing LT , aimed to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and recipient @GENE$ genotypes among @DISEASE$ recipients [ 26 ]	1
274	The authors suggested that recipient @GENE$ TT genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of @DISEASE$ after LT and CC donor grafts might be preferentially allocated to recipients with @DISEASE$ .	1
275	Reactivation of herpes group viruses may also be one of the factors associated with @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT	1
276	Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and human herpes virus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation	1
277	They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [ 27 , 28 ]	1
278	Recently , a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients ( donor or recipient CMV seropositive ) transplanted for @DISEASE$ was performed to evaluate the associations of @DISEASE$ and disease with recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
279	It was found that @DISEASE$ infection was associated with increased risk of @DISEASE$ stage [UNK] 2 and @DISEASE$ grade [UNK] 2 [ 29 ]	1
280	However , their effects on posttransplant @DISEASE$ recurrence still remain questionable	1
281	Data showed that short - term @DISEASE$ does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT [ 30 ] .	1

284	Immunosuppression	1
285	Early data , examining the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ recipients with @DISEASE$ , first reported that methylprednisolone treatment for @DISEASE$ led to a 4 - 100 - fold increase in @GENE$ [ 31 ]	1
286	Since then , an aggravated course of @DISEASE$ reinfection after LT and increased resistance to antiviral therapy have been attributed to the application of specific immunosuppressive medication [ 32 , 33 ]	1
287	Herein , various immunosuppression strategies have been evaluated for their influence on @DISEASE$ recurrence .	1
288	Glucocorticoids	1
289	Glucocorticoids are often given as an induction protocol during LT , and low doses combined with other immunosuppressants are used as maintenance immunosuppression after operation	1
290	In case of @DISEASE$ , recipients receive pulse methylprednisolone to reverse the rejection	1
291	There are convincing data that bolus doses of glucocorticoids given for rejection treatment have a negative impact on @DISEASE$ recurrence	1
292	It is estimated that cumulative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with increased mortality , higher levels of @DISEASE$ , and more severe histological recurrence [ 34 ]	1
293	One recent study demonstrated that glucocorticosteroids specifically increased HCV entry by upregulating the cell entry factors @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
294	The data suggested that the potential effects of high - dose glucocorticosteroids on @DISEASE$ in vivo may be due to increased @DISEASE$ dissemination [ 35 ]	1
295	Previous studies have indicated that the specific @GENE$ T cell response to HCV is important in viral clearance of @DISEASE$ after @DISEASE$	1
296	Moreover , plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of @GENE$ against @DISEASE$ infection in this specific CD4 T cell response [ 36 , 37 ]	1
297	Experimental data have shown that prednisolone suppressed the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by promoting their apoptosis [ 38 ]	1
298	Thus , in a transplant setting , the consensus is that steroid avoidance or slow tapering of the dose is associated with reduced @DISEASE$ recurrence [ 39 , 40 ] , whereas boluses for treating @DISEASE$ can increase the viral load [ 31 ] .	1
299	@GENE$ ( CNIs )	1
300	Cyclosporine is a lipophilic cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids , while tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic	1
301	Both drugs bind with high affinity to a family of @GENE$ ( also called @GENE$ ) , which present in a variety of immune cells	1
302	Immunophilindependent signal transduction via @GENE$ represents a key event in the activation of T cell proliferation by regulating expression of the gene that encodes @GENE$	1
303	Cyclosporine A ( CyA ) binds to @GENE$ , while tacrolimus ( Tac ) binds to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
304	The binding blocks the @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ and subsequently inhibits @GENE$ - induced T cell proliferation by the blockage of @GENE$ production	1
305	Intriguingly , in addition to their promoting role in @GENE$ signalling , @GENE$ are catalysts of protein folding and contribute to the invasion ability of several coronaviruses [ 41 ]	1
306	As to @DISEASE$ , it is well established that @GENE$ have an important role in viral replication and de novo virus production	1
307	Recent data suggest that @DISEASE$ replication is dependent on the interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) to stimulate its RNA binding activity and thereby promote the de novo synthesis of @GENE$ [ 42 ]	1
308	Given the fact that @GENE$ can work as a supportive role in @DISEASE$ infection , it is rational to find out that CyA is capable of the anti - HCV activity through mediating a specific blockade of @GENE$ to @GENE$ [ 43 ]	1
309	As CyA interacts with both @GENE$ and @GENE$ , it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV	1
310	However , there is controversy about the anti - HCV effects of cyclosporine A in vivo	1
311	By contrast , @GENE$ does not have any anti - HCV activity [ 44 ] .	1
312	MMF and MPA	1
313	Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) belongs to the class of antimetabolite immunosuppressive agents	1
314	Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , the active metabolite of MMF , is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
315	In addition to its potent immunosuppressive capacity , the in vitro assay has indicated that MPA has antiviral effect against HCV [ 45 ]	1
316	In @DISEASE$ cell culture models , MPA could induce the expression of important @GENE$ , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 46 ]	1
317	Among these proteins , data showed that @GENE$ was directly involved in the anti - HCV activity of MPA	1
318	Moreover , MPA could have effects in synergy with @GENE$ - on HCV replication in the same @DISEASE$ experiments	1
319	In addition , when combined with @GENE$ - , MPA augmented the transcription of @GENE$	1
320	With the molecular basis of how MPA works in synergy with @GENE$ , proper prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm their synergistic effects against @DISEASE$ in vivo	1
321	On the other hand , although the safety and efficacy of MMF as an immunosuppressive medication in @DISEASE$ patients undergoing @DISEASE$ have been demonstrated , the exact effects on @DISEASE$ recurrence have not been clearly studied .	1
322	Rapamycin	1
323	With low nephrotoxicity and potential anticancer properties , rapamycin has been increasingly used in the transplantation context [ 47 ]	1
324	It has been well known that rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein @GENE$ to form a complex	1
325	This complex inhibits the @GENE$ pathway by directly binding to the @GENE$ , resulting in blockage of cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase and thereby causing inhibition of T cell proliferation	1
326	Intriguingly , rapamycin induces autophagy through inhibiting @GENE$	1
327	Autophagy is a process for catabolizing organelles and other intracellular components to balance cellular metabolism and to promote cell survival during stressful conditions	1
328	In fact , autophagy is also an important event in the regulation of the cellular response against @DISEASE$ [ 48 ]	1
329	It is noteworthy that @DISEASE$ infection induces autophagy in the hepatocytes via the @GENE$ response , and the autophagy induced by HCV is incomplete through blocking the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes [ 49 ]	1
330	The autophagosomes will not be degraded but instead support viral replication	1
331	Recent study demonstrated that @GENE$ could directly interact with the @GENE$ to induce the autophagy [ 50 ]	1
332	In addition , the HCV - induced autophagy may promote infection by reducing the innate immunity [ 51 ]	1
333	Based on these findings , it is conceivable that rapamycin could affect @DISEASE$ recurrence and antiviral interferon therapy	1
334	However , clinical evidence is needed to make sure of its in vivo effect .	1
335	@DISEASE$ reinfection of the graft is almost universal among recipients with active infections at the time of transplantation [ 52 ]	1
336	An accelerated progression of @DISEASE$ is noted in those recipients with recurrent @DISEASE$ after transplant , and at least 25 to 30 % of patients will eventually develop @DISEASE$ within 5 to 10 years [ 53 , 54 ]	1
337	Once @DISEASE$ is established , the first episode of decompensation may occur in as high as 40 % of patients within 1 year	1
338	Apart from the rapid progression of @DISEASE$ , recipients with recurrent @DISEASE$ may also develop severe @DISEASE$ , characterized by @DISEASE$ , rapidly after organ transplantation in the absence of @DISEASE$ causing a very high risk of @DISEASE$ failure [ 55 ]	1
339	For the reason , HCV - related recipients show a worse posttransplant outcome compared to HCV - negative recipients	1
340	A previous study which retrospectively analyzed 11036 patients with 11791 liver transplants confirmed that the @DISEASE$ infection significantly impaired patient and graft survival after LT [ 56 ]	1
341	Focusing on the strategy to recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT , three approaches have been identified according to the timing of treatment : pretransplantation antiviral therapy , posttransplantation prevention and preemptive treatment , and treatment for established reinfection	1
342	[ 58 ]	1
343	It is noteworthy that none of the patients who achieved SVR before LT developed graft reinfection in the study	1
344	In addition to the relative poor efficacy , safety of @GENE$ is another concern in patients with @DISEASE$	1
345	Carrion et al	1
346	reported that 43 % , 29 % , and 8 % of patients suffered from discontinuation , decompensation , and death during therapy [ 57 ]	1
347	Although the incidence of decompensation and death is similar in comparison to control group , treated patients suffered from a significantly higher rate of @DISEASE$ than control group	1
348	Child - Pugh B / C is the only independent factor associated with @DISEASE$	1
349	These data suggested that patients with @DISEASE$ should be closely monitored during @GENE$ therapy and followed by experts with considerable experience	1
350	Direct acting antivirals ( DAAs ) , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ or other @GENE$ inhibitors , are the newly developed agents for HCV treatment	1
351	Current data on HCV treatment using DAA are limited in patients with cirrhosis	1
352	In the phase III trials with telaprevir and boceprevir , there were only a few patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis included [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]	1
353	Although the results from the phase III trials of telaprevir and boceprevir triple therapy showed a higher SVR rates compared to Pegylated IFN / RBV therapy in advanced fibrosis and cirrhotic patients , the severe advanced events rates were also increased in patients receiving triple therapy	1
354	The data from compassionate use of protease inhibitors in viral C cirrhosis ( CUPIC ) cohort also demonstrated an increased serious adverse events rates ( from 30 % to 51 % ) and discontinuation rates ( from 7 % to 12 % ) in cirrhotic nonresponders compared to the phase III trials	1
355	Another study in 20 cirrhotic patients awaiting LT demonstrated that 71 % of patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks with DAA triple therapy	1
356	However , 25 % of patients suffered from early discontinuation , and 10 % of patients had decompensation during therapy	1
357	The results suggest that triple therapy must be administered cautiously with intensive safety monitoring in cirrhotic patients .	1
358	Because of the accelerated clinical course of recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT , strategy to prevent reinfection of the graft is needed	1
359	@GENE$ had been approved to successfully prevent @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT	1
360	It is used in antibody therapy for @DISEASE$ - infected recipients	1
361	However , recent studies using @GENE$  @GENE$ show only transient decrease of @GENE$ levels in liver transplant recipients [ 62 , 63 ]	1
362	Preemptive or early posttransplant antiviral therapy aims to prevent the rapid development of @DISEASE$ before there is evidence of recurrent @DISEASE$	1
363	It is usually initiated within one month after LT	1
364	Compared to immunocompetent subjects , antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression	1
365	A pilot study by Mazzaferro collected 36 HCV - RNA + @DISEASE$ patients who started a 12 - month @GENE$ plus RBV combination therapy within 3 weeks after LT [ 64 ]	1
366	The sustained virological response ( SVR ) was achieved in 33 % of patients	1
367	None of the patients developed @DISEASE$ , and normal histology was also noted in patients with SVR after a median followup of 52 months	1
368	However , higher than 26 % of @DISEASE$ was noted in another study using @GENE$ and RBV combination therapy for more than 12 months [ 65 ]	1
369	Moreover , four other studies using different regiments , two @GENE$ monotherapy and two pegylated - @GENE$ monotherapy , showed a poor effect of less than 20 % of SVR and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation and @DISEASE$ [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ]	1
370	Therefore , more prospective and large - scaled studies are still needed to investigate the most appropriate regimen for Preemptive treatment .	1
371	@DISEASE$ ( HCV ) is a small - enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family	1
372	Since first identified in 1989 , @DISEASE$ has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide	1
373	Mostly @DISEASE$ has a uniform natural history , from @DISEASE$ to the development of @DISEASE$	1
374	The current therapy for @DISEASE$ consists of a combination of @GENE$ and ribavirin	1
375	On the other hand , @DISEASE$ is also the leading indication for liver transplantation	1
376	However , posttransplant @DISEASE$ re - infection of the graft has been reported to be universal	1
377	Furthermore , the graft after @DISEASE$ re - infection often results in accelerated progression to @DISEASE$	1
378	In addition , treatment of recurrent @DISEASE$ after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of @GENE$ - based therapies	1
379	Taken together , poor outcome after @DISEASE$ re - infection , regardless of grafts or recipients , poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons	1
380	The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding @DISEASE$ re - infection after transplant : risk factors , current therapeutics for @DISEASE$ in different stages of liver transplantation , cellular function of @GENE$ , and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry	1
381	Hopefully , this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent @DISEASE$ after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome .	1
382	Owing to relatively poor efficacy and high adverse effect , most experts now delay antiviral therapy till a histological evidence of recurrent @DISEASE$ is established after LT	1
383	However , for patients diagnosed with @DISEASE$ , antiviral therapy must be given as early as possible after LT because of the poor short - term prognosis and rapid @DISEASE$ progression	1
384	Initially , conventional @GENE$ - based therapy was used to treat recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
385	A systematic review , consisted of 27 studies with a total of 689 patients , demonstrated a mean SVR rate of 24 % with conventional @GENE$ - based therapy [ 70 ]	1
386	Compared to conventional IFN - based therapy , pegylated IFNbased therapy showed a significant improvement of SVR rate	1
387	Three recent systematic reviews demonstrated 20 - 40 % of SVR rate in genotype 1 and 50 - 100 % in genotype 2 / 3 subjects using Pegylated @GENE$ - based therapy for recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ]	1
388	The same result is also found in the histological improvement , regardless of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$	1
389	The factors to predict a better SVR are also the same as in nontransplant patients	1
390	Genotype non - 1 , low pretreatment @GENE$ , rapid virological response , and adherence to therapy have been identified as the positive predictors [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ]	1
391	The association between response and @GENE$ is also reported recently [ 26 , 74 ]	1
392	Charlton [ 26 ]	1
393	@DISEASE$ is another poor predictor , and it is almost incurable with @GENE$ treatment when @DISEASE$ develops [ 75 ]	1
394	Safety and tolerance for therapy are also among the major concern in @DISEASE$ recipients with @DISEASE$ recurrence	1
395	Dose reduction , discontinuation , and acute rejection were noted in 44 % ( 38 - 50 % ) , 24 % ( 21 - 27 % ) , and 2 % ( 1 - 3 % ) of patients treated with conventional @GENE$ therapy [ 70 ]	1
396	For the patients treated with Pegylated @GENE$ therapy , a better SVR rate was noted in comparison to the IFN - based group	1
397	Meanwhile , the rejection rate was also found to be elevated with a mean rate of 5 - 10 % ( highest 25 % )	1
398	In addition , dose reduction was noted in over 50 % of patients , and treatment discontinuation was found in around 30 % of patients [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] .	1
399	In treatment of genotype 1 @DISEASE$ , the first generation of DAAs , telaprevir and boceprevir were recently used to enhance the efficacy of the standard regiment , Pegylated IFN plus RBV [ 76 ]	1
400	Although DAAs significantly increase the SVR rate in naïve patients , relapsers , and nonresponders [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] , evidence is still limited about their efficacy in recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
401	In addition , there are some limitations for safety and tolerance	1
402	One critical limitation is the potential interaction with CNI	1
403	One recent study in healthy volunteers showed that boceprevir increased the area under the curve of CsA and Tac by 2	1
404	7 and of 17 , respectively , [ 77 ]	1
405	Another study reported that the concomitant administration of immunosuppressive therapy with telaprevir in healthy volunteers increased CsA and Tac exposures by approximately 4	1
406	6 - fold and 70 - fold , respectively [ 78 ]	1
407	In 2012 , several teams have communicated preliminary results of DAAs use after LT , which are summarized by Coilly et al	1
408	[ 79 ]	1
409	Overall , at 12 weeks of triple therapy , a complete early virological response ( EVR ) was obtained in 71 % of patients treated with boceprevir and in 73 % of patients treated with telaprevir	1
410	Notably , the CsA dose should be reduced by 1	1
411	3 - fold with boceprevir and fourfold with telaprevir	1
412	The Tac dose should be reduced by fivefold with boceprevir and 35 - fold with telaprevir	1
413	It was concluded that DAAs could completely change the prognosis of patients with severe @DISEASE$ recurrence and offer new perspectives for the treatment of @DISEASE$ recurrence in @DISEASE$ patients .	1
414	The current therapy against @DISEASE$ , consisting of a combination of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and ribavirin ( RBV ) , is limited by resistance , adverse effects , and high costs	1
415	The absence of preventive regiment is a major limitation for patients undergoing LT for @DISEASE$	1
416	Moreover , accelerated progression to @DISEASE$ after graft reinfection and limited efficacy of @GENE$ - based therapies for recurrent @DISEASE$ are two major clinical issues leading to poor posttransplant outcome of the @DISEASE$ recipients [ 80 ]	1
417	Thus , novel preventive and therapeutic antivirals are urgently needed	1
418	Viral entry is required for initiation , spread , and maintenance of infection	1
419	HCV entry is a multistep process orchestrated by a number of @GENE$ .	1
420	These factors include the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and tight junction proteins @GENE$ and occluding	1
421	A clear understanding of the detailed mechanisms of HCV entry may shed light in the ways to prevent the liver graft from @DISEASE$ recurrence .	1
422	Cells through @GENE$	1
423	Humoral responses are often thought to play a key role in controlling @DISEASE$ infection [ 81 ]	1
424	In clinical setting , patients spontaneously resolving from @DISEASE$ tend to have an early induction of neutralizing antibody response	1
425	In contrast , @DISEASE$ patients have a delayed initiation of neutralizing antibody response	1
426	Moreover , the variety of strategies the virus evolves to escape antibodies - mediated neutralization , including the accelerated evolution and the diversity of HCV [ 82 ]	1
427	Overall , the capacity of HCV to mutate continuously allows a high plasticity and an ability of the virus to adapt to variable environmental conditions and escape the host ' s immune responses leading to @DISEASE$ persistene	1
428	HCV entry to the hepatocytes requires interaction of its @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and the cell membrane [ 83 ]	1
429	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ contain putative @GENE$ [ 84 ]	1
430	While little is known about the role of @GENE$ in HCV entry , several domains in @GENE$ have been defined to bind to @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , two important @GENE$ ( described in the next paragraph )	1
431	These interactions through @GENE$ help HCV evade host immune responses and enter the hepatocytes	1
432	For example , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , the first @GENE$ of @GENE$ , plays an important role in viral fitness	1
433	It has been demonstrated that @GENE$ was involved in SR - BI - mediated HCV entry [ 85 ]	1
434	Therefore , @GENE$ has been suggested to be a target for @GENE$ , but its high variability results in poor crossneutralization potency of @GENE$ across different @DISEASE$ isolates [ 86 ]	1
435	It is well known that host humoral responses are thought to play a critical role in controlling @DISEASE$	1
436	Several studies reported that broadly neutralizing @GENE$ might be directed against @GENE$ within @GENE$ and mostly inhibit E2 @GENE$ interaction [ 87 , 88 ]	1
437	Currently , new conformational and conserved epitopes have been identified in the @GENE$ of @GENE$ [ 89 ]	1
438	The conserved nature of these epitopes holds great promise for the development of potent inhibitors for HCV entry .	1
439	Several cell surface molecules of the target cells have been identified to interact with HCV , including @GENE$ , the @GENE$ , highly sulfated heparan sulfate ( HS ) , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , occludin ( @GENE$ ) .	1
440	@GENE$ , a ubiquitously expressed @GENE$ , has been demonstrated to interact with the soluble truncated form of HCV @GENE$ [ 89 ]	1
441	Its large @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) seems to play a critical role in this interaction process	1
442	Moreover , studies have identified several amino acid residues throughout the @GENE$ and HCV E2 , which might be crucial for E2 @GENE$ binding [ 90 , 91 ]	1
443	@GENE$ , an @GENE$ with a large @GENE$ , is highly expressed in the liver [ 92 ] .	1
444	Physiologically , @GENE$ binds a variety of @GENE$ ( e	1
445	g	1
446	, @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and is involved in bidirectional cholesterol transport at the cell membrane	1
447	The LEL of @GENE$ has been demonstrated to interact with @GENE$ [ 93 ]	1
448	Recent studies suggest that the interplay between @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ is required for HCV entry [ 94 , 95 ]	1
449	@GENE$ are critical components of tight junctions , which regulate paracellular permeability and polarity	1
450	@GENE$ , a @GENE$ , is predominantly expressed in the liver [ 96 ]	1
451	Intriguingly , @GENE$ may localize to the tight junction and the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes [ 97 ]	1
452	Recent studies suggest that nonjunctional @GENE$ may be also involved in HCV entry [ 48 , 98 ]	1
453	@GENE$ is a @GENE$ expressed in the tight junction of polarized cells	1
454	Several studies have shown that @GENE$ is probably involved in the late postbinding event of HCV entry [ 99 , 100 ]	1
455	As HCV circulates in the blood in association with @GENE$ and @GENE$ , the @GENE$ has also been proposed as an attachment and / or entry factor for HCV [ 100 ]	1
456	The @GENE$ has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum - derived HCV into @DISEASE$ HepG2 cells by binding virus - LDL particles [ 101 ]	1
457	Since cholesterol has been shown to be necessary for HCV cell entry , it is rational that other @GENE$ might also have a role in this process	1
458	More recently , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , a @GENE$ , has been demonstrated as a new @GENE$ [ 102 ] .	1
459	Using a functional RNAi kinase screen , recent study identified @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , two receptor @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) which regulate a number of key cellular functions , as host factors for HCV entry [ 103 ]	1
460	The results showed that the identified @GENE$ mediated HCV entry by regulating @GENE$ associations and viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion , implying that inhibition of @GENE$ function may constitute a new approach for the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$ .	1
461	process	1
462	This process is tightly orchestrated by several @GENE$	1
463	In brief , HCV is believed to first interact with @GENE$ and @GENE$ on the membrane surface of hepatocytes to allow concentration of the virion	1
464	Subsequently , interaction with other @GENE$ such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ultimately leads to viral internalization via the socalled @GENE$ - mediated endocytosis	1
465	Fusion between viral and endosomal membranes is followed by release of the @GENE$ into the cytosol , where translation and replication take place	1
466	Finally , HCV particles are assembled and released from the hepatocytes .	1
467	@DISEASE$ ( HCV ) was a member of Flaviviridae family virus , and seven major genotypes ( Genotype 1 [UNK] 7a ) have been identified with distinct regional distribution patterns	1
468	@DISEASE$ is a major cause of @DISEASE$ worldwide , and @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$ has increasingly become the leading indication for @DISEASE$ ( LT )	1
469	It has been well known that HCV reinfection following LT examined by @GENE$ detection using the polymerase chain reaction occurs almost universally [ 1 ]	1
470	The natural history of @DISEASE$ reinfection is substantially changed after LT with accelerated rate of @DISEASE$ recurrence of 8 - 44 % in 5 - 7 years [ 2 ]	1
471	It has been pointed out that HCV reinfects the liver graft at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ]	1
472	The virus source is attributed to the blood itself with a high probability [ 4 ] .	1
473	Recently , accumulated data have tried to unravel the potential molecular mechanisms of HCV entry	1
474	Some fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) studies described the critical role of the association between @GENE$ and CLDN1 @GENE$ in HCV entry [ 104 , 105 ]	1
475	Next , a rate - limiting role for @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ has been reported [ 106 ]	1
476	The in vitro study demonstrated that increased @GENE$ expression would enhance entry and internalization of HCV	1
477	Several studies investigating the postbinding cellular mechanisms found that the ability of HCV penetration into the hepatocytes may depend on @GENE$ - mediated endocytosis [ 107 , 108 ]	1
478	After internalization , fusion occurs between viral and endosomal membranes	1
479	Recent assay further showed that the fusion may be low of pH and temperature dependent and facilitated by cholesterol [ 109 , 110 ]	1
480	Although the detailed molecular mechanism of HCV entry still needs more investigations , it is conceivable that HCV internalization and fusion may offer many targets for the development of HCV entry inhibitors .	1
481	Interfering with HCV entry into the hepatocytes holds great promises for the development of novel drugs	1
482	Several potential targets are suggested : ( 1 ) blocking virus - target cell interaction during attachment and binding ; ( 2 ) interfering with postbinding events and ( 3 ) interfering with viral fusion	1
483	Various modalities may be adopted as HCV entry inhibitors : neutralizing antibodies for @GENE$ , blocking @GENE$ specific for @GENE$ , and small molecular compounds against @GENE$ or @GENE$ .	1
484	@GENE$ is one of these potential targets	1
485	Imidazole - based compounds mimicking an @GENE$ in the LEL of @GENE$ compete for HCV E2 @GENE$ binding [ 111 ]	1
486	These drugs bind E2 in a reversible manner and block E2 @GENE$ interaction while having no effect neither on @GENE$ expression nor on @GENE$ interaction with physiological partner molecules	1
487	In addition , recent study demonstrated that @GENE$ completely protected human liver - uPA - SCID mice from a subsequent challenge with HCV consensus strains of different genotypes [ 112 ]	1
488	However , administration of @GENE$ after viral challenge had no effect	1
489	@GENE$ , which block the interaction of @GENE$ with HCV , are another interesting strategy to prevent HCV entry	1
490	@GENE$ have been demonstrated to inhibit HCVcc infection in vitro [ 113 ]	1
491	Moreover , small molecule inhibitors of @GENE$ have recently been developed	1
492	For example , ITX5061 is a compound that inhibits entry of HCVpp from all major genotypes and @DISEASE$ infection without affecting viral replication [ 114 ]	1
493	In addition , recent study demonstrated that a @GENE$ targeting @GENE$ efficiently precluded @DISEASE$ infection and viral spread after LT in vitro and in vivo [ 115 ]	1
494	Kinetic studies suggest that this small molecule inhibitor targets HCV entry during an early postbinding stage	1
495	@GENE$ has been suggested to play an important role in cell - cell transmission	1
496	Recently , @GENE$ inhibiting @DISEASE$ infection in vitro have been developed [ 116 ]	1
497	The results have shown that @GENE$ efficiently block cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that are resistant to @GENE$	1
498	As mentioned above , @GENE$ and @GENE$ are two newly established @GENE$ for HCV entry	1
499	Thus , their respective inhibitors , erlotinib and dasatinib , are also regarded as promising HCV inhibitors in preventing @DISEASE$ reinfection after LT [ 103 ] .	1
500	In addition to @GENE$ , HCV internalization and fusion are complex processes that also offer several targets for antivirals	1
501	A recent study demonstrated that long phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ( PS - ON ) inhibited HCV internalization without affecting viral binding and replication [ 117 ]	1
502	The human liver - chimeric Alb - uPA / SCID mouse model also showed that PS - ON block de novo @DISEASE$ infection	1
503	These data shed light on the promise of PS - ON as future clinical solution .	1
504	Recurrent @DISEASE$ after liver transplantation has increasingly become a major clinical issue that the hepatologist and transplant surgeons should face	1
505	During the past decade , numerous therapeutic approaches based on both basic research and clinical evidences have been reported , but the effective strategy still needs more efforts to be approved	1
506	Meanwhile , many critical questions remain in several aspects of @DISEASE$ , including the viral infection cycle activities , the detailed structure , composition , and function of the HCV virion in host cells	1
507	In addition , current standard of therapeutic formula consisting of @GENE$ combined with ribavirin and an @GENE$ inhibitor is ineffective or only partially effective	1
508	In fact , as reviewed in this paper , many novel inhibitors or @GENE$ targeting @GENE$ and host factors hold promise to effectively prevent or treat @DISEASE$	1
509	Hopefully , these future strategies will improve the overall outcome of @DISEASE$ recipients after liver transplantation [ 101 ] .	1
510	The viral load can return to the pretransplant values within 4 days after transplantation and may be influenced by the usage of corticosteroids [ 5 ]	1
511	@DISEASE$ occurs between 2 - 5 months after transplant , and it is characterized by @DISEASE$ [ 4 ]	1
512	In the early reinfection stage , the @DISEASE$ injury occurs only after 3 weeks	1
513	@DISEASE$ is established about 6 - 12 months after transplantation	1
514	The stage of @DISEASE$ is characterized by a decrease of viral load and a pattern of @DISEASE$	1
515	A variant form of posttransplant @DISEASE$ is @DISEASE$ that occurs in < 10 % of patients , frequently associated with high viral load and immunosuppression	1
516	Usually , it occurs within 1 - 6 months after transplant and can progress to @DISEASE$ in 3 - 6 months [ 6 ]	1
517	This form is characterized by very high viral load , cellular ballooning , low inflammation , and a Th2 intrahepatic immunological response	1
518	These features suggest that the @DISEASE$ is due to a direct @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$ .	1
519	To date , the absence of preventive strategy for HCV reinfection after transplant is a major challenge for the @DISEASE$ recipients undergoing LT	1
520	As mentioned above , reinfection of the liver graft is universal and characterized by accelerated progression of @DISEASE$	1
521	Furthermore , treatment of recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT is compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon - based therapies	1
522	In addition , poor outcome after graft reinfection of HCV has increasingly become a major problem faced by the hepatologists and transplant surgeons	1
523	Thus , novel preventive and therapeutic strategies of @DISEASE$ reinfection are urgently needed .	1
524	Recurrence of @DISEASE$ in the liver allograft is universal after LT , and its natural history is variable	1
525	It has been estimated that approximately 20 % of recipients will progress to @DISEASE$ within 5 years of transplant [ 7 ]	1
526	Overall , @DISEASE$ is more aggressive in the posttransplant recipients than in patients whose immunity is intact [ 8 ]	1
527	Accelerated disease progression is multifactorial and probably depends on a number of variables , including host , donor , viral , and external factors	1
528	However , the definite interactions between these factors and recurrent @DISEASE$ in the liver allograft still remain controversial and poorly defined	1
529	Thus , to identify recipients at risk for rapid @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT will be helpful especially when considering treatment with the currently available antiviral agents either as prophylaxis or therapy	1
530	To date , a number of risk factors have been mentioned regarding this clinical issue .	1
531	One study , reviewing 307 patients who underwent LT for @DISEASE$ over a 10 - year period , suggested that advanced donor age , prolonged donor hospitalization , increasing recipient age , and elevated recipient MELD scores were found to increase the relative risk of @DISEASE$ recurrence [ 9 ]	1
532	Moreover , earlier studies have advocated that @DISEASE$ recurrence may be more severe when older donors are used [ 10 , 11 ]	1
533	In addition , the type of donor used may have an impact on HCV reinfection of the graft after LT	1
534	One clinical observation suggested that @DISEASE$ recurrence is more severe in living donor LT compared to cadaveric LT [ 12 ]	1
535	However , another study reported that there are no differences observed in @DISEASE$ recurrence rate , severity of intrahepatic pathology , or graft and patient survival between living donor LT and cadaveric LT recipients [ 13 ]	1
536	As to the source of HCV reinfection in the allograft , it may occur at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ]	1
537	The blood itself has a high probability to be the origin of this allograft reinfection [ 4 ]	1
538	It is indeed valuable that identifying these risk factors before LT , particularly when matching donors to @DISEASE$ recipients , may decrease the incidence of @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT .	1
539	Load	1
540	@DISEASE$ infection of the allograft is believed to be an extremely dynamic process	1
541	HCV virus binds to the new allograft at the time of reperfusion , and viral replication occurs within hours after LT	1
542	The impact of recipients ' viral load on HCV recurrence following LT is still uncertain , but a clear understanding of HCV kinetics after LT will contribute to the development of strategies to prevent @DISEASE$ of the allograft	1
543	An earlier study , which analyzed HCV kinetics during and immediately after LT , found a sharp decrease in HCV viral load during the anhepatic phase and immediately after graft reperfusion [ 3 ]	1
544	This decrease was presumably attributed to massive binding of HCV to the hepatocytes	1
545	In other words , reinfection is immediate after reperfusion	1
546	Powers et al	1
547	also reported that @GENE$ levels dropped with an average half - life of 0	1
548	8 hours during the anhepatic phase [ 14 ]	1
549	The authors also mentioned that viral loads then continued to drop up to 23 hours after implantation , and began to rise as soon as 15 hours after the anhepatic phase	1
550	Moreover , the viral load reached a plateau before rising , suggesting that a nonhepatic source supplied virions and balanced their intrinsic clearance	1
551	It was estimated that nonhepatic sources were at most responsible for 4 % of total viral production and the remaining 96 % occurred in the liver .	1
552	Other similar studies pointed out that viral loads in serum returned to pretransplant levels within 24 to 48 hours after the procedure	1
553	Within weeks after transplant , viral loads would be approximately 1 log higher than pretransplant levels [ 4 , 15 ]	1
554	However , studies investigating the impact of pretransplant viral load on the likelihood of @DISEASE$ recurrence have produced controversial results	1
555	Several reports indicated that pretransplant viral load did not correlate with either the likelihood or timing of @DISEASE$ recurrence following LT [ 16 ]	1
556	By contrast , one study including 166 @DISEASE$ - infected recipients demonstrated that before transplant , HCV viral load greater than 1 million viral equivalents / mL was associated with decreased graft and patient survival [ 17 ]	1
557	Given the hypothesis that pretransplant treatment of HCV will reduce or prevent @DISEASE$ posttransplant recurrence , it has been advocated that patients with @DISEASE$ on the transplant list should be considered for therapy with the goal of obtaining sustained virological response ( SVR ) prior to LT [ 18 ] .	1

735	The Rational Design of Therapeutic Peptides for @GENE$ using a Substrate - Based Approach OPEN	1
736	Because @GENE$ forms the same interactions with a free alanine and the N - terminal alanine residue of a poly - alanine peptide substrate , we believe that the crystal structures of @GENE$ complexed with free amino acids reflect the interactions between @GENE$ and the N - terminal amino acid residues of at least simple peptide substrates 4	1
737	All of the free amino acids in the crystal structures bound to @GENE$ in a similar manner as alanine , with the exception of key differences in their side chain interactions	1
738	The @GENE$ were oriented in a pocket in the @GENE$ with hydrophobic walls and an @GENE$ ( Fig	1
739	3A )	1
740	The side chains with different lengths were able to fit into the pocket because of the open end and were found to primarily form hydrophobic interactions with the walls of the pocket ( Fig	1
741	3B )	1
742	For example , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ of the methionine side chain formed hydrophobic interactions with Met349 / Gln208 , Ala346 , and Phe467 on the pocket walls ( Fig	1
743	3B )	1
744	Polar side chains were also able to form additional interactions with @GENE$ as in the case of arginine where the guanidine group formed a cationic - Pi interaction with Phe467 ( Fig	1
745	3B )	1
746	In general , the @GENE$ - binding affinity of amino acids is positively associated with the extent of hydrophobic or other affinity - increasing interactions between their @GENE$ and the pocket walls	1
747	Consequently , amino acids with long , nonpolar side chains like leucine generally have high @GENE$ - binding affinity	1
748	Analysis of the crystal structures of @GENE$ complexed with non - favored amino acids found that those residues all shared one unique feature - their @GENE$ had unfavorable interactions with the catalytically critical carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 from @GENE$ ( Fig	1
749	3B )	1
750	For example , the @GENE$ atom of isoleucine was 2	1
751	4 Å away from the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 , respectively ( Fig	1
752	3B )	1
753	At these short distances , a strong van der waals ( VDW ) repulsion existed between the atoms	1
754	Additionally , the O  group of aspartic acid formed an unfavorable charge repulsion with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 ( Fig	1
755	3B )	1
756	As a comparison , the side chains and disfavored ( Ile and Asp ) P1 residues for APN	1

758	The catalytically critical hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 and the C - terminal carboxyl group of amino acids is shown as a red dashed line in the structure with Ala , but is omitted in other panels for clarity	1
759	The interactions between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 and amino acid side chains are shown as black dashed lines	1
760	The distance between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 and the nearest atom on amino acid side chains is shown as a bidirectional arrow .	1

764	To identify sequences for inhibitor development , a selection of 14 - mer peptides from the @GENE$ that underwent complete hydrolysis during the assay were compared using label - free quantitation of peptide cleavage kinetics ( Supplemental Figure 2 )	1
765	Five - residue long peptides containing P1 - P4  residues from primary cleavages in the library were synthesized and tested for their ability to prevent the cleavage of a fluorogenic alanine substrate by @GENE$	1
766	From these initial peptides , only @GENE$ was able to appreciably inhibit substrate cleavage with an IC 50 of 6	1
