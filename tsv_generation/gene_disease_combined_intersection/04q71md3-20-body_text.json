{"cord_uid": "04q71md3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3930559", "divid": "20", "text": "Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global influenza virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement , specifically , geographical proximity , demography and economic measures , antigenic divergence , epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support ( Fig . 2 ) . Instead , we find consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant driver of the global dissemination of H3N2 influenza viruses . This is reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable ( * 1 on a log scale ) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the model ( posterior probability . 0 . 93 and Bayes factor . 760 ) . This effect size means that viral lineage movement rates are about 15 times higher for connections with the highest passenger flow compared to connections with the lowest flow , controlling for all other predictors . The result is robust when we repeat the analysis ( i ) using different partitions of sampling locations ( air communities and different geographic partitions , Fig . 2 ) , ( ii ) using different sequence sub - samples for the air communities ( Fig . S1 ) , ( iii ) using the full data set or a small but more balanced number of sub - samples ( Fig . S2 ) , and ( iv ) using a more liberal prior specification on predictor inclusion ( Fig . S3 ) . We down - sampled particular air communities or geographic regions relative to their population sizes ( Text S1 ) , which still leaves considerable heterogeneity in sample sizes , explaining why they are included as an explanatory variable in the GLM model . Our aim is not to demonstrate a role for sample sizes in phylogeography , but by explicitly including them as predictive variables , we raise the credibility that other predictors are not included in the model because of sampling bias . We note that the sample size predictors may in fact absorb some of the effect of air travel because a GLM model that only considers passenger flux as a predictor of H3N2 movement among the air communities results in a higher mean effect of size of about 1 . 5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 72}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 464}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
