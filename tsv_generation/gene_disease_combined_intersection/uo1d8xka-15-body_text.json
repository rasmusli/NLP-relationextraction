The obtained trees for the medium - size data set are shown in the additional files 8 , 9 , and 10 . The algorithms ProtPars , NJ , and UPGMA were used . All these algorithms have been distributed using the above Quascade workflows and deployed on a cluster of PCs . The utilized cluster consists of 16 nodes comprising 32 CPUs . Its detailed specification and architecture are shown in Table 1 and Figure 7 , respectively . However , the algorithms ML and Mr . Bayes could not be run on the existing system with the medium dataset since it became apparent that these algorithms require further optimization in terms of distribution and / or more processing resources .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 691}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
