We find some homogeneity in the time series models for the respiratory - complaint backgrounds across the Midwest emergency departments studied . Our simulations show that the balance between specificity , sensitivity , and timeliness to detect an outbreak signature differs by the emergency department and the choice of filter . The linear and exponential filters provide a good balance .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
