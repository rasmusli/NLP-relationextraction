Specifically , the 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 ( 67 % ) geographic regions designated by IUCN , with over 90 % of all species distributed in more than one region ( Table S2 ) . For example , Pipistrellus tenuis is widely distributed from the Oceania region ( oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean ) westwards into Pakistan and Afghanistan , where its range overlaps with a diversity of species from North Africa and Europe ( e . g . , Tadarida teniotis , Rousettus aegyptiacus , Rhinolophus ferrumequinum , Eptesicus bottae , and Myotis blythii ) . Within Western Asia , nearly a quarter of all bat species are widely distributed in more than half of the 20 countries that comprise the region , with Pipistrellus kuhlii recorded in all but two countries ( i . e . , Bahrain and Qatar ) ( Table S2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
