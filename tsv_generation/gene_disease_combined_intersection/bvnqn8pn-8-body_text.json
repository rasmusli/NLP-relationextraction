A white code means that the condition is not relevant or does not have an acute onset and is not affecting the vital signs ; it can be reevaluated by the triage nurse if the symptoms modify and it might gain a higher priority . A green code indicates patients with normal vital signs but relevant , acute - onset symptoms ; they should be reevaluated by the triage nurse every 30 - 60 minutes until medical evaluation . A yellow code is for those with severe lesions and altered vital signs that require rapid medical evaluation , so that these cases are closely communicated to the attending physician . A red code means that the condition is life - threatening ( vital functions are compromised ) and the patient requires immediate evaluation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
