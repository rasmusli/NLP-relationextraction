Overall , 78 . 8 % of cases and 54 . 2 % of controls were co - infected or co - colonized ( crude OR = 3 . 3 , 95 % CI : 1 . 8 - 6 . 0 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Co - detection on nasal swab of S . pneumoniae and RSV was more frequent in cases than in controls ( respectively , 15 between cases and controls ( respectively , 5 . 9 % [ N = 7 ] vs . 3 . 1 % [ N = 3 ] , P = 0 . 32 ) . A doseresponse relationship was apparent between the number of microorganisms found in nasal swabs and the risk of being a case ( Fig 1 ) . Distribution of S . pneumoniae and RSV differed by season with higher rates of S . pneumoniae in January - June and of RSV in July - September ( Fig 2 ) . Univariate analysis revealed that S . pneumoniae , human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus detection in nasal swabs were significantly associated with pneumonia in Mali ( Table 3 ) . Multivariate analysis reinforced linkage of these pathogens with pneumonia , independently of patient age , gender , period per quarter and the presence of other pathogens significantly coupled with increased risk of pneumonia ( Table 3 ) . PAF was the highest for S . pneumoniae ( PAF = 46 % , 95 % CI : 30 - 59 % ) . Contribution of human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A were lower , with PAFs of 9 % ( 95 % CI : 7 - 11 % ) , 21 % ( 95 % CI : 16 - 25 % ) and , 8 % ( 95 % CI : 6 - 10 % ) , respectively . Fig 3 reports the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes detected in nasal swabs from cases and controls . The most prevalent serotype in pneumonia cases and controls was serotype 6A / B ( 18 . 6 % vs . 11 . 2 % , P = 0 . 13 ) . Serotypes 1 and 5 were more frequent in pneumonia cases than in the controls : 6 . 8 % vs . 0 % , P = 0 . 009 , and 4 . 2 % vs . 0 % , P = 0 . 04 , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1605, "end": 1628}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1742, "end": 1751}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 400}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 745}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 825, "end": 829}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1034}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1121, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1283}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1709, "end": 1719}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
