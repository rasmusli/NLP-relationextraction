Hamsters inoculated with ANDV mount an inflammatory response , as measured by elevated mRNA encoding pro - inflammatory mediators , prior to succumbing to the disease [ 55 ] . Infection also results in the activation of the adaptive immune response , characterized by antigen - specific proliferation of T cells and the generation of virus - specific antibodies [ 74 , 86 ] . In contrast , SNV , which is highly pathogenic in humans , replicates in hamsters , but does not cause disease and is cleared by the immune response [ 87 ] . Passaging of SNV in hamsters results in a virus that is able to replicate efficiently and cause a persistent infection similar to what is seen in the rodent reservoir , yet still does not cause disease [ 88 ] . Examination of immune responses elicited by ANDV ( pathogenic in hamsters ) and SNV ( non - pathogenic in hamsters ) showed that passaged SNV evoked a stronger adaptive immune response than did ANDV ; however , ANDV infection induced a much stronger innate immune response at late time points , despite both viruses replicating to similar levels . Depletion of T cells did not alter the outcome of infection [ 74 , 86 ] ; thus , these data suggest that , at least in the hamster model , the activation of the T cell - mediated immune response is not responsible for immunopathogenesis , and perhaps the innate immune response , either elicited from infected endothelial cells , macrophages and / or neutrophils , might contribute to disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 466}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
