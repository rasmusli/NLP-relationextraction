In fact , no difference was observed in growth performance of weaned pigs supplemented with hop \u03b2 - acids ( 120 , 240 , or 360 mg / kg ) or colistin ( 40 mg / kg ) during a trial period of 35 days [ 151 ] . Moreover , the supplementation of weaned pigs with two Macrocephala flavored powder ( 3000 mg / kg ) increased significantly villus height in the duodenum and jejunum compared to that observed in colistin ( 300 mg / kg ) supplemented pigs [ 152 ] . However , these studies ( Table 4 ) , were conducted in experimental conditions and in most cases in healthy weaned pigs . Thus , further research is needed to demonstrate the stability and the efficacy of such alternatives ( probiotics , AMPs , medicinal plants ) in field conditions as well as the safety of these substances in animals and for consumers . Also , work is needed to optimize the doses of these substances to incorporate in the feed to ensure their effectiveness in PWD control . The financial cost and the ease of administration of such alternatives are the other important criteria that should be taken into consideration in pig production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 256}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1215}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
