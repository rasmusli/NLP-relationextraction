However , we consider our results to reflect true bronchial infection , as we applied procedural methods , which were shown to limit strongly the risk for contamination [ 13 , 20 , 26 , 27 ] . In particular , we chose to use a cut - off of \u2265 10 4 cfu / ml for bacterial BAL - culture , although in adults a cut - off of \u2265 10 3 cfu / ml has demonstrated to be discriminative [ 28 , 29 ] . The applied cut - off was also used previously by others , studying children with chronic bronchitis [ 30 ] . Moreover , although FOB + BAL were only performed once in the majority of patients , our results probably reflect chronic bronchial infection as all our samples were collected during stable clinical state .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 184}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 263}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 663, "end": 682}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 833}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
