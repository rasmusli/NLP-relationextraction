[ 16 , 17 ] . As proposed by these authors , our model incorporates two elements : Any inhalational anthrax outbreak starts with the dispersion of the anthrax spores . Once spores are inhaled by a subject , in the incubation stage spores either germinate or are cleared out the lung . For the spores that germinate during incubation , the later stages of the disease are the prodromal and fulminant stages , followed by death . Buckeridge , et al . [ 16 ] model the spread of spores over a grid covering the Norfolk , Virginia region using a Gaussian plume model . Their model considers the source and Time series plots strength of the anthrax attack , along with prevalent wind directions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 69}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 253}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 304}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 781, "end": 789}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
