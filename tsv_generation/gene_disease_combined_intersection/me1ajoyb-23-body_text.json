Many difficulties exist for studying hantavirus infections of their reservoir hosts , including the lack of molecular and immunological reagents , methods for experimental investigation , and that few reservoir species have been colonized for laboratory use . In addition , pathogenic hantaviruses require BSL - 3 and / or ABSL - 4 containment , which presents logistical hurdles for examining the reservoir host / hantavirus relationship . Despite these limitations , novel instrumentation , particularly those for transcriptome profiling ( e . g . , RNA - Seq ) and metabolomics , and development of molecular and cellular methods , provide an opportunity to rapidly develop the tools necessary for examining reservoir host responses using a systems biology approach . The key feature of these new technologies is that they are species - independent in the data they generate , but they require significant computational and bioinformatics resources .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 20}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 213}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
