Since cats infected with L . infantum may not be sick and , therefore , not present any clinical signs , it is questionable whether healthy cats should be tested for this infection . In our opinion , cats with no clinical signs and / or clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with leishmaniosis should be tested for Leishmania infection if they are used as blood donors , since it has been shown for humans and dogs that blood products from infected individuals may transmit infection [ 89 ] . Antibody testing and blood PCR are advisable as indicated for dogs . Furthermore , testing can be done for exportation purposes to countries where leishmaniosis is not endemic and may require cats to be tested for infection before importation . Finally , cats with clinical conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapies should be preliminarily tested in endemic areas , as clinical cases of FeL were diagnosed in cats under long term immunosuppressive treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 66}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 118}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 474, "end": 508}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 538}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 580}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 884, "end": 898}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
