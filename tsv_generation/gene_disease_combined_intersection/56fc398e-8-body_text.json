[ 32 ] demonstrated that even in the absence of precise locations of farms , accurate predictions of the impact of interventions are possible . We aim to develop an understanding of the predictive power of mathematical models when only a subset of the network information is available . We develop a model to simulate the spread of a rapidly spreading disease such as FMD through the UK cattle movement network . Mathematical models have previously played a key role in determining the risk of disease spread through networks of livestock movements for diseases such as FMD [ 17 , 18 , 21 , 33 ] , bTB [ 12 , 13 , 19 ] and bluetongue virus [ 34 , 35 ] . Our aim in this paper is to investigate the ability of such models to provide policy advice in countries where only partial information regarding livestock movements is available .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 409}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 611}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 677}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
