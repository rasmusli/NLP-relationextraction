In this analysis , air travel again predicts viral movement ( posterior probability . 0 . 99 and Bayes factor . 18000 ) , but the movement is also inversely associated with geographical distance between locations ( posterior probability = 0 . 76 and Bayes factor = 87 ) , and , less intuitively , with origin and destination population densities ( although the size of the latter effects are weaker , Fig . 2 ) . The negative association of population density with viral movement may suggest that commuting is less likely , per capita , to occur out of , or into , dense subpopulations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
