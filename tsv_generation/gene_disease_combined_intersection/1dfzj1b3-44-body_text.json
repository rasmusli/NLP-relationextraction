The main components in both cases were p - cymene , \u03b3 - terpinene , linalool , thymol and carvacrol . The percentages changed according to the method of extraction used , nevertheless p - cymene and thymol dominated in both cases . The great difference was found to be the presence of thymoquinone in the volatile oil obtained through the supercritical fluid extraction . The presence of this component could be the responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test , in which the lipidic substrate was sunflower oil [ 60 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
