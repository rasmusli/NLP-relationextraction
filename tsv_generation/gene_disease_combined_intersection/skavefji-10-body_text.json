Briefly , BAL was performed by instillation of three consecutive aliquots of sterile saline solution ( 20 - 30 - 30 ml ) into the bronchial tree at the area that was most abnormal on the chest radiography . The right middle lobe or lingual segment was chosen in patients with bilateral diffuse infiltration . BAL fluid that was first retrieved was discarded , and BAL fluid that was subsequently retrieved was collected . The total cell count was determined using a hemocytometer . The corresponding amount of BAL fluid for 10 3 cells was centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a Thermo Shandon Cytospin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . , Waltham , MA , USA ) , at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature . The slide was airdried and stained with Wright - Giemsa stain . Differential cell counts that included percentages of neutrophils , lymphocytes , alveolar macrophages , and eosinophils were determined .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 421}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
