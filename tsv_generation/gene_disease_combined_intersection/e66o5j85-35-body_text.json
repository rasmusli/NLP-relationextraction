Ours is the first case - control investigation of pneumonia etiology in children from Mali ( S1 STROBE checklist ) . The results should serve to better manage pneumonia not only in these children but also in those from neighboring countries . Data quality was enhanced by centralized microbiological analysis in the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory ( Lyon , France ) . In addition , this analysis should serve to better focus multicentric pneumonia studies that will permit us to assess the global etiologies of pneumonia and to compare etiologic agents between countries and continents . Some limitations should be underlined . First , microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult due to the lack of single reliable test . Then , at the individual level , it is difficult to establish if a positive nasal swab denotes etiology or nasopharyngeal colonization ; particularly for bacterial agents such as S . pneumoniae because of the high asymptomatic carriage . However , at the population level , addition of a control group permits to evaluate and control for the prevalence of carriage in asymptomatic children . In a pneumonia etiology study , it would be interesting to correlate the threshold cycle ( Ct ) values obtained from RT - PCR with lower airway specimens to establish more precisely the relationship between positive nasal swab and etiology of pneumonia , according to the microorganism [ 30 ] . Second , because the study was implemented in one hospital in Mali , external validity might be limited . However , Gabriel Tour\u00e9 University Hospital is a reference center in the country , and then source population is not limited to the city of Bamako . Third , study power was confined to detecting some linkages ( i . e . serotypes associated with the risk of pneumonia ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 129}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 292}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 401}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 751}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 905}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1357, "end": 1367}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1595, "end": 1605}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 2010, "end": 2020}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
