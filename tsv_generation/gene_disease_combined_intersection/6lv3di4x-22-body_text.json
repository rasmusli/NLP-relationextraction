In contrast to in vivo work , such cultures permit controlled kinetics studies of virus infection and basolateral and apical shedding , which is not possible in vivo . The same applies to the macrophage work in terms of virus replication and shedding and analyzing the impact of epithelial - cell - derived immunomodulatory factors . Such models may be used for any species and therefore permit analysis of species differences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
