Results from the zero - dose control studies ( Fig . 1 , top left ) confirmed that the aerosol irradiation chamber efficiently transmitted the aerosolized viruses through the system , after which the live virus efficiently infected the test mammalian epithelial cells . Figure 2 shows the surviving fraction , as a function of the incident 222 - nm far - UVC dose , of exposed H1N1 aerosolized viruses , as measured by the number of focus forming units in incubated epithelial cells relative to unexposed controls . Linear regressions ( see below ) showed that the survival results were consistent with a classical exponential UV disinfection model with rate constant k = 1 . 8 cm 2 / mJ ( 95 % confidence intervals 1 . 5 - 2 . 1 cm 2 / mJ ) . The overall model fit was good , with a coefficient of determination , R 2 = 0 . 95 , which suggests that most of the variability in virus survival was explained by the exponential model . The rate constant of 1 . 8 cm 2 / mJ corresponds to an inactivation cross - section ( dose required to inactivate 95 % of the exposed viruses ) of D 95 = 1 . 6 mJ / cm 2 ( 95 % confidence intervals 1 . 4 - 1 . 9 mJ / cm 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
