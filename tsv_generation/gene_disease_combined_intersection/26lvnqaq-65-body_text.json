The specificity of the staining was the same from 5 to 100 HAU in the infundibulum and magnum , while non - specific staining was slightly increased at the level of the isthmus and uterus ( Additional file 3 ) . Nevertheless , irrespective of the amount of virus used , positivity at the level of the epithelia was maintained .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
