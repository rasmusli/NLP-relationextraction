International collaborative research is most effective and relevant to policy makers when organized around specific hypotheses and validated with experimental data [ 146 , 147 ] . Further , international research is most likely to be successful if the specific topics and hypotheses are identified by local ( in - region ) scientists and stakeholders . Toward this aim , WAB - Net is working with key personnel from throughout the region to develop a robust collaborative research program on bats and bat - associated CoVs . This multinational research program will use a combination of field , laboratory , and analytical methods to address outstanding questions surrounding drivers of host - virus dynamics .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 576}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
