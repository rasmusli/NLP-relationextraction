Prerequisites for reducing the risk include improved surveillance , active contact tracing , and the initiation of animal host searching [ 30 , 31 ] . During the outbreak in Korea , MERS was classified as a notifiable infectious disease and was subjected to surveillance [ 32 ] . Since MERS is an imported disease in Korea , it is recommended that precautions be taken before travel and that the time of returning from travel and incubation period be considered . This study showed a low seropositivity in the population of individuals quarantined due to contact with MERS cases . However , there is a possibility that the seropositivity rate was underestimated for the following reasons . Firstly , the participants of the present study were mostly non - healthcare workers and were relatively healthy . Thus , the risk of infection was low . Secondly , the overall participation rate was 48 . 9 % , whereas it was 36 . 8 % in the patient group at a higher risk of infection . Moreover , we only surveyed 10 . 9 % of the quarantined individuals . Therefore , the actual rate of asymptomatic infections may be higher than reported in the present study . Lastly , the present study may have been conducted too late . In a previous study , MERS - CoV ELISA results indicated that the antibody response was highest after 3 weeks from symptom onset [ 33 ] . Although no reports have analyzed the duration of antibody presence in MERS patients regardless of symptoms , a recent study of severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS reported that antibodies in some patients persisted for up to 2 - 3 years after infection [ 34 , 35 ] . Blood sampling for serologic test in this study was performed on contacts between October and December 2015 , while exposure to the confirmed case occurred between May and June 2015 ( a gap of 5 months ) . Thus , a loss of the MERS - CoV antibody titer could have taken place despite actual asymptomatic infections ; therefore , the actual rate of asymptomatic infection may be higher than the rate presented in this report .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 332}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 374}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 436}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 718}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1570, "end": 1575}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1634, "end": 1661}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1665, "end": 1670}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
