The virus has been known to exhibit an endemic pattern and to cause yearly epidemics in spring and summer in temperate climates [ 50 ] . PIV1 was isolated in smaller numbers throughout the study period ( in 28 of 36 months ) , and we could not observe the biennial pattern of fall epidemics seen elsewhere [ 51 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
