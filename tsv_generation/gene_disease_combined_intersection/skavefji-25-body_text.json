To minimize bias associated with antimicrobial therapy , all patients who received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours were excluded , regardless of the adequacy of prior antimicrobial therapy . By using strict enrollment criteria , however , only a small proportion of pneumonia patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL was finally included ( Figure 1 ) , which might have influenced on the results . However , positive likelihood and negative likelihood ratio , which are not influenced by disease prevalence , were good , which supports the validity of the data . In clinical practice , the results might be applied to patients who have received antimicrobial therapy more than 24 hours . That is , if BAL fluid cellular analysis shows evident pleocytosis even after antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours , it would be a strong suggestion for bacterial etiology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 373}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 852}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
