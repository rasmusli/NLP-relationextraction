In 2009 , only 2 skunks were reported rabid in Humboldt County suggesting that rabies infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted from a typical pattern of spillover from skunks to foxes to one resulting from fox - to - fox transmission . The reported numbers underestimate the extent of the outbreak since additional foxes exhibiting unusual or aggressive behavior were euthanized but not tested ( S . Chandler , USDA , personal communication ) . This epizootic of rabies in Northern California raised concerns not only because the primary species involved was gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) and not striped skunks which are the terrestrial reservoir species in this region , but also because this led to a significant spike in attacks by rabid animals on humans and their pets [ 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 30}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 358}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 400}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 789}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
