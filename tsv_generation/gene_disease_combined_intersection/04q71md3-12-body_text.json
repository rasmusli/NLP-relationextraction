Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread , but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors , such as human mobility and demography . Here , we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics . We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration , whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales . We demonstrate the power of our inter - disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009 . Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 480}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 795}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 926, "end": 945}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
