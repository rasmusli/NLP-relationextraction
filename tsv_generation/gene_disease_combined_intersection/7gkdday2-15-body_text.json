( 10 / 46 ; 22 % ) , E . agglomerans ( 4 / 46 ; 9 % ) , and H . influenzae ( 3 / 46 ; 6 % ) ( Fig 2B ) . On the other hand , 7 % ( 2 out of 30 ) nasal swab specimens which had been collected from asymptomatic participants were culture positive and only S . pneumoniae was found in both cases . The data obtained from symptomatic cases demonstrate for the first time that E . agglomerans might play a role as one of the major bacterial pathogens ( 9 % ) of ARIs in under - five children in Bangladesh ( Fig 2B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 91}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 768}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
