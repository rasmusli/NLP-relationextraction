It has been shown , for example , that the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system [ 21 , 24 ] , though perturbations to the endemic equilibrium take longer to die out as n increases [ 22 , 26 ] . When contact rates vary seasonally , for example , to mimic the aggregation of children in schools [ 28 , 29 ] , changes in p ( t ) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections [ 25 , 26 , 30 ] . An issue that has received surprisingly little attention , despite its obvious applicability to emerging infections and possible ' ' deliberate exposure , ' ' is the influence of latent and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population . This is in contrast to the conceptually similar situation of within - host dynamics of viral disease , such as HIV , for which some models already adopt realistic distributions to describe stages in the cell life cycle [ 31 , 32 ] . In particular , Lloyd [ 33 ] has shown how parameter estimates made from viral load data are affected by different assumptions about these distributions . Here we are interested in the application of this work to between - host transmission dynamics . As can be seen in Figure 1B , changes in the gamma distribution parameter n have substantial quantitative consequences for the epidemic curve : in comparison to a gamma - distributed model , the epidemic given by the exponentially distributed model ( i ) takes off at a dramatically slower rate , ( ii ) predicts a significantly smaller ( approximately 56 % ) peak number of cases , and ( iii ) lasts much longer ( almost twice as long ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1082}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1092, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
