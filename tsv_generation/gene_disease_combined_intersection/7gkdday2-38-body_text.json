A community - based study conducted in Bangladesh could identify respiratory viral pathogens in only 66 % of ARI cases and the detection rate was lower than the detection rate calculated for this study [ 10 ] . However , the study did not consider bacterial pathogens . On the other hand , the studies of respiratory infections among children of Zambia and Madagascar reported the detection rates of respiratory pathogens in 76 . 8 % and 74 . 6 % specimens , respectively , and these studies focused on the detection of both viral and atypical bacterial pathogens [ 20 , 21 ] . A similar study conducted in China demonstrated 67 . 5 % overall pathogen detection rate [ 22 ] . These all suggest that our findings in terms of pathogen detection are consistent with the reported data of similar studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 355}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 547, "end": 570}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
