With low nephrotoxicity and potential anticancer properties , rapamycin has been increasingly used in the transplantation context [ 47 ] . It has been well known that rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein FKBP12 to form a complex . This complex inhibits the mTOR pathway by directly binding to the mTOR complex 1 , resulting in blockage of cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase and thereby causing inhibition of T cell proliferation . Intriguingly , rapamycin induces autophagy through inhibit mTOR . Autophagy is a process for catabolizing organelles and other intracellular components to balance cellular metabolism and to promote cell survival during stressful conditions . In fact , autophagy is also an important event in the regulation of the cellular response against viral infections [ 48 ] . It is noteworthy that HCV infection induces autophagy in the hepatocytes via the unfolded protein response , and the autophagy induced by HCV is incomplete through blocking the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes [ 49 ] . The autophagosomes will not be degraded but instead support viral replication . Recent study demonstrated that NS5B could directly interact with the host proteins to induce the autophagy [ 50 ] . In addition , the HCV - induced autophagy may promote infection by reducing the innate immunity [ 51 ] . Based on these findings , it is conceivable that rapamycin could affect HCV recurrence and antiviral interferon therapy . However , clinical evidence is needed to make sure of its in vivo effect .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 10}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 84}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 189}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 482}, "obj": "ne"}]}
