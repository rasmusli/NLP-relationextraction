The LEL of SR - BI has been demonstrated to interact with E2 HVR1 [ 93 ] . Recent studies suggest that the interplay between lipoproteins , SR - BI , and HCV envelope glycoproteins is required for HCV entry [ 94 , 95 ] . CLDNs are critical components of tight junctions , which regulate para permeability and polarity . CLDN1 , a 23 kDa four - transmembrane protein , is predominantly expressed in the liver [ 96 ] . Intriguingly , CLDN1 may localize to the tight junction and the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes [ 97 ] . Recent studies suggest that nonjunctional CLDN1 may be also involved in HCV entry [ 48 , 98 ] . OCLN is a 65 kDa four transmembrane protein expressed in the tight junction of polarized cells . Several studies have shown that OCLN is probably involved in the late postbinding event of HCV entry [ 99 , 100 ] . As HCV circulates in the blood in association with LDL and VLDL , the LDL receptor has also been proposed as an attachment and / or entry factor for HCV [ 100 ] . The LDLR has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum - derived HCV into CD81 - deficient HepG2 cells by binding virus - LDL particles [ 101 ] . Since cholesterol has been shown to be necessary for HCV cell entry , it is rational that other cholesterol - uptake receptors might also have a role in this process . More recently , Niemann - Pick C1 - like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor ( NPC1L1 ) , a 13 - transmembranedomain cell surface cholesterol - sensing receptor , has been demonstrated as a new HCV entry factor [ 102 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 129}, "obj": "ne"}]}
