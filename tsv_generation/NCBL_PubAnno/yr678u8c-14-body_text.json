Work performed so far focusses mainly of members of the betacoronaviruses , MHV and SARS - CoV . Detailed characterisation of the membrane structures induced in cells infected with alphacoronaviruses , like transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) , or gammacoronaviruses , like IBV , needs to be performed . Although these viruses are related , it is possible that there are differences in the mechanisms of membrane rearrangement and the types of structures induced . In addition , the location of RTC assembly and the site of viral RNA transcription and replication need to be identified . The membranes induced in MHV and SARS - CoV infected cells are complex and how the different structures play a role in virus replication is currently unknown . Furthermore , the mechanism by which these rearrangements are generated is not understood . Whether MHV induced membranes are altered upon inhibition of ERAD tuning and which proteins might be involved in hijacking the pathway remains unknown . Moreover , whether this pathway is important for the replication of other coronaviruses is also unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 411}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 454}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 461}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 487}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
