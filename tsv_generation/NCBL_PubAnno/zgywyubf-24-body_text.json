We have identified the ability of the ORF2 protein of the HEV to inhibit host cell NFKB activity . However , whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects , can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus . Nevertheless , the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 423}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
