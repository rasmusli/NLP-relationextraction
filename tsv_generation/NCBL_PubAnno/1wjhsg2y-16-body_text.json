Past research efforts have focused largely on cataloging the bat diversity in a single country [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] or adjacent countries in the region ( i . e . , Arabia [ 92 ] and Caucasus [ 93 ] ) . These initial efforts contributed some of the first information about bat systematics , ecology , behavior , and geographic distributions in Western Asia . However , a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region , including new country records [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] and updated species ' distributions [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] . The growing number of new distributional records , as well as taxonomic revisions [ 102 , 103 ] and new species discoveries [ 96 , 104 ] , published within the last decade points to a clear need for continued bat diversity assessments and field research throughout the region .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
