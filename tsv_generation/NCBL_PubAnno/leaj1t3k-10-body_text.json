This novel approach is based on the discovery 30 years ago that nucleic acid molecules could be used to specifically target complementary viral nucleic acid sequences and inhibit viral replication [ 52 , 53 ] . With these new promising molecules comes the ability to simultaneously target multiple viral sequences , which would preclude the selection of drug resistance . Mechanisms of antiviral activity exerted by CPP conjugates . These antiviral agents can target retroviruses , as shown for HIV , non - retroviral RNA viruses , as shown for the negative - sense RNA EBOV and HCV , and DNA viruses , as shown for HSV . Interference with viral RNA processing and translation further inhibits viral replication . CPP conjugates can also be designed to target virus - infected cells . CPP can also inactivate the virion and render cells resistant to infection , inhibiting cell infection . proCasp3 stands for pro - caspase 3 ; RT stands for reverse transcription ; Tn stands for transportan .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
