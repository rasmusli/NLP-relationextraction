Two pairs of inversion loci , ( 4593 , 4596 ) Data from Illumina sequencing were used to test the hypothesis that sub - consensus variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies in the historical samples than those sub - consensus variants that did not . Loci shown in Figure 5 where inversion of the dominant and minor variants occurred between the historical and later samples are referred to as ' ' inversion sites ' ' . The frequencies of sub - consensus variants at the inversion sites were compared to that of variants at non - inversion sites present in the 1995 samples ( but not enriched to the consensus level in the 2003 / 10 samples ) to determine if those variants at inversion sites were present in higher numbers in the pre - outbreak samples . The average frequency of sub - consensus variants at inversion sites was slightly but significantly higher than that of sub - consensus variants at non - inversion sites ( p = 0 . 03 , twosample t - test one - tailed ) . Samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak ( prior to July1 , 2009 ) had increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected at the inversion sites as a sub - consensus mutation , although the difference fell short of statistical significance ( p = 0 . 08 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
