[ 8 ] CFD simple object model an airplane cabin dye / tracer gas The movement of a crew member or a passenger could carry contaminants in its wake to as many rows as the person passed Wang and Chow [ 17 ] CFD three different moving human models an isolation room expiratory droplets Human walking disturbed the local velocity field , and the increase of walking speed could effectively reduce the overall number of suspended droplets Choi and Edwards [ 16 ] CFD a realistic walking human model a room compartment tracer gas ( sulfur hexafluoride , SF 6 ) Faster walking speed resulted in less mass transport from the contaminated room into the clean room cabin is significantly different from the diffusion of gaseous contaminants [ 8 , 18 , 19 ] . The methods used for risk assessment of expiratory aerosols and gaseous contaminants are also different [ 20 ] . Until now , studies on the effects of human movement on aerosols transmission and infection risk distribution are still rare . In this work , the effects of human movement on respiratory infectious disease transmission are investigated . An in - flight outbreak case is used for investigation . A manikin with a detailed human profile is also used in the computational geometry . The Eulerian - Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols . The infection risks of the occupants are assessed by using quantitative risk analysis , and the influence of human movement on infectious disease transmission is also analyzed . Likelihood analysis is then performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and the different human movement pattern assumptions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1085}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1503, "end": 1522}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
