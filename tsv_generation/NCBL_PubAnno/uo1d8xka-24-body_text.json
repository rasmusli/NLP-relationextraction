Most of these tools require an understanding of programming or scripting languages , such as Perl , Python , Java , and UNIX - scripts . Recent examples of such systems in bioinformatics include Biopipe [ 15 ] , BioWBI [ 16 ] , Taverna [ 17 ] , Wildfire [ 18 ] , KDE Biosciences [ 19 ] , gRNA [ 20 ] , Biowep [ 21 ] , and BioWMS [ 22 ] . Each deployment is therefore subject to its own code development and testing . Although programming languages offer sophisticated control over the intended procedure , the learning curve and overheads in terms of human resources are difficult to justify . Quascade has been developed with this problem in mind .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
