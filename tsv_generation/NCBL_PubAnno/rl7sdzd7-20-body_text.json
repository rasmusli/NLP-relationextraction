The junction at the right borders of the transgenes were amplified by PCR from the MS8 / RF3 DNA sample using the displacement ( outer ) primers of the LAMP reactions , MS8 - RF3 DisplR ( B3c ) separately with MS8 DisplF ( F3 ) and RF3 DisplF ( F3 ) , to amplify the MS8 and RF3 junctions , respectively ( see Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . The fragments were cloned into pGEM - T vector ( Promega , Southampton , UK ) and transformed into DH5\u03b1 . Clones containing the correct inserts were confirmed by sequencing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
