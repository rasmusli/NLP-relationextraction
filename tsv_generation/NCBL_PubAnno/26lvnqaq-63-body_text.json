In the magnum , virus binding occurred at the level of the ciliated epithelium , and although positivity was highly specific , staining intensity was lower than the one recorded in the infundibulum . The isthmus showed no attachment of the virus to the epithelial cells while staining localized to granules within secretory glands in the lamina propria . The uterus showed a highly specific attachment of the virus to the cytoplasm of epithelial goblet cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
