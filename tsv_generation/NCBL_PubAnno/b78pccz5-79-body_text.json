However , also substantial reductions have been proposed in the earlier work within the EU funded IAIAQ project [ 20 ] . The three alternative scenarios ( and two additional source control scenarios ) described earlier were tested to support policy development for controlling the risks and reducing the burden . The overall comparison of these scenarios in EU - 26 is presented in Figure 4 . The achievable health benefits were 20 % for the dilution scenario , 38 % for the filtration scenario , and 44 % for the indoor source control scenario ( changing from 41 % to 54 % depending on assumed source reductions ) .
