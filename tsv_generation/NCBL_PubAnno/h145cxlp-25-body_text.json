A significant age shift towards younger children , from a median age of 5 to 3 years , had already been observed in a comparison of the pandemic and the first post - pandemic season in Germany [ 20 ] . The continued shift towards younger patients in the third season is likely to be due to increasing immunity in the older paediatric population , after previous contact with A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 . Seroprevalence data from Germany had already shown evidence for A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 infection in as many as 25 % of children aged 1 - 4 years and 48 % of 5 - 17 year - old children for the pandemic season 2009 / 10 [ 26 ] . A similar shift towards younger hospitalized children [ 27 , 28 ] and towards younger children with severe paediatric A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 - associated influenza from the pandemic season to the first post - pandemic season had also been detected in other European countries [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 19}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 938, "end": 978}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
