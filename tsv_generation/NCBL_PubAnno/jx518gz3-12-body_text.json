If food for blow flies is contaminated by pathogens , the flies might ingest significant numbers of pathogens . One possible mechanism for mechanical transmission of pathogens by blow flies is regurgitation and the feces on the food source [ 13 , 14 ] . The effectiveness of mechanical transmission through regurgitation may depend on the viability and titer of pathogens in the fly ' s body . The accumulated droppings at a poultry farm should be a good breeding site for blow flies . If the flies reproduced at a poultry farm , they should have many opportunities for contact with viruses in the feces of infected chickens and / or their dead bodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
