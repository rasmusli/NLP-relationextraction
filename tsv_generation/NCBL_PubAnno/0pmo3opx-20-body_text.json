A number of limitations exist when using single - amino acid chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates to determine aminopeptidase specificity with P1 \u2032 reporter groups , as an example , potentially altering the P1 specificity profile . In addition to reporting on prime - side specificity , our global approach also allowed for the identification of individual synthetic peptides that are bona fide substrates and served as a template for APN inhibitor design . APN has emerged as important pericellular protease target in aggressive cancer . We envision that the substrate specificity preferences identified here will both guide the development of next - generation APN - targeted therapeutics as well as aid in the discovery of its endogenous substrates to further expand our knowledge of its role in biology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 616}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 714}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 844}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
