{"cord_uid": "fl6wlhjs", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2203979", "divid": "23", "text": "Next , we describe a simplified health - utilization model for people entering the ED , based on ideas discussed in [ 16 ] . During the incubation stage , we assume that no infected people enter the ED . Non - infected people that enter the ED for other chest problems are part of the background data . During the prodromal and fulminant stages we assume a simple Markov model of utilization : each infected subject is a Bernoulli event , independent across days . At the prodromal stage people enter the ED with probability P d on a weekday and P w on weekends . At the fulminant stage the probability of entering the ED , P f say , is larger than the probabilities in the prodromal stage . The reason is that at the fulminant stage , the anthrax symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack and therefore people enter the ED with higher probability . The differentiation between weekday and weekend is irrelevant at this stage . We suppose that a small percentage of people in the prodromal or fulminant stages are misdiagnosed and thus need to re - enter the system . Also , we assume that people can potentially be misdiagnosed a maximum of two times during the same attack ( 10 % in the first visit and 5 % in the second visit ) . The probabilities of entering the ED after being misdiagnosed are increased by an additive factor , C , for every additional entry . Our model allows for a small probability of drop - out , to account for other ways of leaving the system ( e . g . , pharmacy visit ) . The health - utilization model could easily be extended to include , e . g . , varying probabilities of entering the ED by stage / time , and / or more advanced ways to exit the system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 269}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 748}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 796}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
