During human movement , the time step was 0 . 1 s for moving speed of 0 . 5 m / s and 0 . 05 s for 1 . 0 m / s . Each case was computed in a 4 - node Linux cluster . Each node of the cluster had eight processors ( 2 . 4 GHz Intel 64 ) and 16 GB of memory . The calculation time of each case was 180 - 220 hours , depending on the total number of time steps and iterations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
