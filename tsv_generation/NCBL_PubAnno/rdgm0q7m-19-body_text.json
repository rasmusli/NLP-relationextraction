A short ( 58 nt ) 32 P - labelled transcript encompassing the minimal PRRSV frameshiftstimulatory region was incubated with nsp1 [UNK] , PCBP1 ( or PCBP2 ) or both proteins , prior to electrophoresis on a 4 % non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel . As shown in Figure 4A , a single RNA - protein complex was observed , the formation of which required both nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP1 ( or PCBP2 ) . Using a broader range of PCBP2 concentrations at saturating levels of nsp1 [UNK] , the estimated K d of the interaction was found to be 130 nM ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . In the presence of PCBP2 , the PR mutant of nsp1 [UNK] was able to bind the target RNA indistinguishably from the WT protein , but the RBM mutant gave a smeary pattern , indicative of weak , non - specific , RNA binding ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . As a control , a version of the RNA probe mutated in the C - rich region ( CC2 , Ref . 18 ) was also tested , and no nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 binding was evident ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . A supershift assay was carried out to confirm nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP association with the RNA in the complex . The PRRSV RNA was incubated with nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP2 and subsequently with specific antibodies targeting either protein prior to EMSA . As shown in Figure 4B , in lanes from reactions with an added anti - PCBP2 monoclonal antibody , an additional band of slower mobility was seen consistent with the presence of PCBP2 in the RNA / protein complex . A monoclonal antibody targeting the NTD of nsp1 [UNK] did not yield a novel EMSA product , but a more slowly migrating species was observable with a polyclonal anti - nsp1 [UNK] serum . These observations support the view that the RNA / protein complex seen contains both proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 759}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
