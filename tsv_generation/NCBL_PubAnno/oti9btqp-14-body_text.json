Five to six week old female IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice ( n = 4 ) were immunised i . m . , with electroporation - mediated delivery , three times at 2 - week intervals with either the control pVax1 plasmid or ZIKV - prME vaccine plasmid vaccine . The serum was collected from immunised mice at days 0 , 14 , 21 , and 35 , and splenocytes were harvested from mice 1 week following the final immunisation ( day 35 ) . The splenocytes from vaccine - immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response as indicated by levels of SFU per 10 6 cells in an ELISpot assay ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . The results from ELISA analysis , using rZIKV - E as a capture antigen , show detectable anti - ZIKV serum IgG by day 14 ( titres of ~ 1 : 1 , 000 ) and these levels were boosted with subsequent vaccinations with binding antibody titres reaching at least 1 : 100 , 000 ( Supplementary Figure S3B , C ) . By comparison , the PRNT 50 titre for the day 35 postimmunisation samples was 1 : 60 ( data not shown ) . The results indicate that IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice immunised with the consensus ZIKV - prME vaccine are capable of generating anti - ZIKV cellular and humoral immune responses supporting further study in this model of putative vaccine effects in a pathogenic challenge .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 322, "end": 337}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 413}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
