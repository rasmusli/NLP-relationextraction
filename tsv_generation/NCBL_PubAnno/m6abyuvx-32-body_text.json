To understand the mechanisms responsible for the reduction of the number of macrophage , we performed another experiment to confirm whether the macrophages were infected with vaccinia virus inoculation . However , based on PCR analyses ; vaccinia virus DNA was not present in liver tissue that contained macrophages ( Figure S7 ) . Furthermore , apoptosis of macrophages was not detected in liver samples ( Data not shown ) . Based on these results , it is unlikely that the reduction in the number of macrophages was due to apoptosis induced by vaccinia virus infection . Although rVV - N25 reduced the number of macrophage , precise mechanism is still unknown . Further examination to elucidate the mechanism is required .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 94}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 695, "end": 710}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
