The efforts toward development of vaccines against this deadly virus have also been continuously increasing leading to the emergence of promising interventions . The two viruses , in other words , SARS and MERS have some common challenges in the development of an efficacious vaccine . As evident from reports , the aged population is more vulnerable to MERS - CoV . The lesson learnt from preclinical studies of SARS - CoV suggests that vaccines fail to protect aged animals , while being effective in young ones . Similarly , in clinical settings , the risk of mortality is even higher in individuals with chronic conditions or an immunocompromised state . An effective vaccine , thus , should offer universal protection , including the vulnerable populations . To do so , there is a need to evaluate the promising vaccines in the comorbid chronic conditions and the immunocompromised rodent models . Since the virus can comfortably replicate in macrophages , the risk of vaccine - derived immunopathology cannot be negated and must be considered using heterologous challenge models . Further , balance must be struck between protection and excessive immune activation while evaluating a successful vaccine candidate . The vaccine development against MERS - CoV is mostly influenced by the SARS - CoV . However , to aid the development of better vaccines , there is need to further enhance the knowledge of pathology of MERS - CoV and outline critical differences between SARS and MERS - CoV . mAbs offers a window of opportunity , as a few candidates have shown potency in in vitro testing . However , care needs to be taken in humanizing mAbs so as to minimize the antimouse antibody response . Epitopes identified from mouse neutralizing mAbs can be neutralized for humanizing MERS - CoV . mAbs targeting RBD are reported to have higher potency than therapies directed against other S protein regions of MERS - CoV , as these could recognize critical residues for DPP4 binding . However , changes in such critical residues may render these mAbs ineffective and lead to development of escape mutant strains of the virus . As discussed , a few promising peptides have also been developed against MERS - CoV . The antiviral activity , stability and solubility of these peptides can be further improved similar to the peptides developed against HIV . This will lead to the development of optimized next generation peptides having better inhibitory action directed against MERS - CoV . Alternatively , as a novel approach , the peptide inhibitors can be combined with mAbs ( e . g . , RBD specific ) . The combination can be evaluated for the synergistic effect against divergent and resistant strains . Studies are also needed to explore novel delivery technologies and optimizing vaccine immunity with a suitable combination of adjuvants . In summary , there have been encouraging results in the area of the development of MERS - CoV vaccines in preclinical settings . However , there are challenges related to efficacy , safety and drug delivery that need further consideration before proceeding to clinical trials . Focused research in this direction can help reduce the disease burden caused by MERS - CoV and prevent outbreaks , especially among the aged and immunocompromised population .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 34}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 148}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 373}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 382}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 536}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 779, "end": 798}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1013, "end": 1032}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1424, "end": 1435}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1593, "end": 1604}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1654, "end": 1665}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 2370, "end": 2377}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
