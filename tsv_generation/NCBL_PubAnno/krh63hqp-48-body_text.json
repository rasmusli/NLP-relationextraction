The resulting \" frozen \" lineage appeared less mutated compared to all other contemporary H1N1 strains ( i . e . , porcine strains and a few rare H1N1 strains appearing in humans but not derived from the frozen strain ) . Consistent with the genetic attenuation model , the frozen human H1N1 lineage disappeared in 2009 , and may now be extinct .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
