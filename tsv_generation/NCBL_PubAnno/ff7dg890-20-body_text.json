One approach is to fit model parameters to data by ' ' trajectory matching , ' ' where one looks for the combination of parameters that , in a statistically rigorous sense , give rise to dynamics most consistent with observed patterns [ 34 , 35 ] . Alternatively , one may use the well - established result that during the initial stages of an epidemic , the growth rate is approximately exponential [ 17 , 20 ] , with the rate determined by R 0 . First , we use this approach to examine , in general , how the distribution of the latent and infectious periods may affect the estimation of R 0 from initial epidemic data . To illustrate that our results are not specific to this methodology , we then take incidence data from an influenza outbreak and parameterize the epidemic models using trajectory matching .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 930}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
