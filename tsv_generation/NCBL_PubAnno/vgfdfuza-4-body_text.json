We used a purposive sampling method to recruit informants in key roles across sectors relevant to the issue of AMR in Singapore . Potential participants were identified from experts in the area of AMR in Singapore , and were approached for an in - depth interview via email explaining the purpose of research . A total of 21 participants from within and outside Singapore were recruited in this study ( Table 1 ) . The participants held expertise in human , animal , or environmental health and worked at either ministry , healthcare institution , academia , or civil society . Most participants were from the human health sector . We had difficulty recruiting participants from the environmental sector as potential participants showed more reservation in accepting the invitation to be interviewed , perhaps based on less knowledge about AMR . We were eventually able to recruit an academic and public health official from the environmental sector . Face - to - face in - depth interviews were conducted by three of the researchers ( S . R . S . , S . T . T . and H . L . - Q . ) in English . Among the interviewers , two were Research Associates and one was an Associate Professor . All interviewers were trained in qualitative research . The interviews were conducted in a quiet space at the preferred location of the participants . Each interview lasted an hour on average and was audio - recorded . There were no repeat interviews . A semi - structured question guide was used to explore the main areas of concern for the participants , in their fields and areas of interest . The question guide was developed with questions focusing on participants ' experiences and perceptions of AMR policy and practice including awareness , key challenges and facilitators in their particular area of expertise , and possible strategies and solutions to address key challenges in the Singaporean context . Participants were not remunerated for the interview .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 186}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 272}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 915}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1760, "end": 1764}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
