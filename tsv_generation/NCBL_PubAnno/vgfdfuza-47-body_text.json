Some of the process indicators were antimicrobial use for human and animal health , and infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene in hospitals . It was suggested that the Singapore government played a prime role in mandating the standardization , transparency , and sharing of data with the NAT . The motivation of the workforce was attributed to the competition , prestige , and reputation of the workforce . In the hospital setting , metrics and outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship such as average defined daily dose and percentage of appropriate antibiotics prescribed , and length of hospitalization for each department are often reported and shared among the various departments within the hospital . The transparency of data highly motivated the workforce to perform well in these benchmarking exercises . The following quote is an example of such occurrence : \" More important I think is the peer pressure and peer standing . And when it ' s made the department target and communicated by the head of the department , no one wants to be the worst department in the stats when they are shown up . So there ' s lot of department pride and that ' s what drives stuff . Doctors are often competitive , some of the nurses too . And no one wants to be the idiot that lets the team down . \" - I03 , Human Health", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
