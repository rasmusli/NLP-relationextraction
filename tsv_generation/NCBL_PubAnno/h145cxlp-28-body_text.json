Both incidence estimates were higher than those previously reported by nation - wide PICU surveillance for the pandemic and the first post - pandemic season , suggesting possible underreporting in previous studies without active screening . Comparison of the first and third post - pandemic seasons indicated an age shift of severe A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 towards younger children , which might be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population . The large proportion of children with underlying chronic conditions indicates the need for a more consistent implementation of the current recommendations for influenza vaccination of specific risk groups in Germany . These children could also profit from herd protection , if universal influenza vaccination was successfully introduced in Germany . Authors ' contributions AS designed the study , coordinated data collection , performed the analysis , interpreted the data , and drafted the manuscript . BW and CP performed multiplex PCR and subtyping on laboratory specimens , interpreted virological data , and revised the manuscript . JGL supervised the study , supported data interpretation , and revised the manuscript . The clinical data were collected by the Bavarian PICU Study Group on Influenza and Other Viral ARI , from Oct 2010 to September 2013 . All authors read and approved the final manuscript .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 163}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1498, "end": 1508}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
