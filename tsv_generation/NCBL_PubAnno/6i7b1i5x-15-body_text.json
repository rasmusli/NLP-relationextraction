A specific immune response to an agent typically has an initial inherent immune component that leads to antigen presentation to effector cells . Receptors on the effector cell surface ( T - cell receptors in T cells and Immunoglobulin ( IG ) , or antibody , in B cells ) bind specific targeted areas of the agent , termed epitopes . Specific recognition by T and B lymphocytes leads to stimulation , lymphocyte replication and clonal expansion ; what is termed an oligoclonal response . Oligoclonal expansion is shown in peripheral IgM + B cells in KD [ 5 ] . Detailed pathological studies have revealed what are termed oligoclonal plasma cell infiltrates in KD arterial specimens [ 101 ] , leading to the cloning of antibody J and association with the presence of the spheroid ICIs as previously discussed [ 102 , 103 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 683}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 793}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
