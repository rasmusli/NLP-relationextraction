The counts increase rapidly in the first week , then stay fairly constant ( except for the spikes ) , for a week and then slowly drop to zero after the second week . The small spikes are due to the different probabilities of entry in the prodromal stage . Although the shapes at each quantile are similar , the magnitude and duration of the extra radiographs counts differ . The counts drop to zero at different time points for the different quantiles . They drop to zero after 3 weeks for the 0 . 025 quantile , after 4 weeks for the 0 . 5 quantile , and after 7 weeks for the 0 . 975 quantile . These patterns in the observed time - varying distribution of the outbreak signature are a strong motivation to not use deterministic outbreak patterns , as used by some authors , since deterministic outbreak patterns do not give a realistic assessment of detection methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
