The Y - maze test is well known as a hippocampal - dependent short - term learning task . In our MIA model , a remarkable loss of neurons was observed in the amygdala and cerebral cortex of the offspring , but not in the hippocampus . The formation of memory is encoded in a broad network of cortical / subcortical regions including the hippocampus , cingulate cortex , and amygdala 42 . Moreover , the amygdala is directly connected to and dynamically interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28 . Therefore , a decreased number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex could consequently result in short - term memory impairments . In this model , increased activation of astrocytes was observed in the white matter and amygdala , which be related to impaired short - term memory 28 , 41 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 882}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
