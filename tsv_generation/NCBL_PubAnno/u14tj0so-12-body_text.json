First , due to a high pseudoknot initiation penalty in its underlying energy model , many of its predicted structures did not have pseudoknots . Also low band penalty ( i . e . , penalty for addition of pseudoknotted stems or bands ) in its energy model encouraged addition of pseudoknotted stems when a pseudoknot was predicted . Second , if the first structure http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 input to HFold contains base pairs that are not in the true pseudoknot - free structure for the given RNA sequence or is not the complete pseudoknot - free structure ( i . e . , it does not include all the base pairs in the pseudoknot - free structure ) , HFold is often unable to predict the known pseudoknotted structure as output .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
