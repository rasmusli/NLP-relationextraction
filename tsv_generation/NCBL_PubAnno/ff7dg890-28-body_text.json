We have also formulated a model that takes into account the distribution of the latent period during quarantine and find similar qualitative results to those shown in Figure 4 . However , if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period and there is only a small amount of isolation of infected individuals , then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma - distributed model , because more exposed individuals in the exponentially distributed model will leave quarantine before they develop the infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
