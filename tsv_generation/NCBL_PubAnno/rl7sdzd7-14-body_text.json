This can be explained by the fact that we do not use a base pair destabiliser , such as betaine , in the reaction buffer . Since we are detecting down to near single copies of templates , our results suggest no benefit to the sensitivity of the assay by their inclusion . The consistent amplification within all dilutions showed that LAMP is an ' all or nothing ' reaction , with little of the tailing off effect that is often observed in PCRs with diluting templates . This makes it easy to identify positive reactions . Together with specificity and the speed at which reactions can be performed , LAMP is an excellent method for diagnostics [ 8 , 10 , 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
