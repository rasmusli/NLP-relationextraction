Previous studies have demonstrated ADE in vitro due to FccR - or complement - mediated mechanisms or to modulation of the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 [ 52 , 53 , 54 ] . Here we demonstrate that enhancement in vitro occurs at the level of transcytosis across epithelial cells and involves FcRn . In vivo , Ig isotype , as well as neutralizing activity , are likely to play a determining role in whether an antibody might protect from or enhance infection . As demonstrated recently , intrarectally applied dIgA1 HGN194 mAb , but less so the IgG1 version , prevented SHIV infection following intrarectal challenge [ 40 ] . In vitro , the dIgA1 inhibited transcytosis , whereas we now show that the IgG1 version enhances transcytosis at pH 6 . 0 . Another study showed that , compared to irrelevant - and no - antibody controls , there was an increase in the number of transmitted / founder SHIV variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of a non - neutralizing IgG1 mAb [ 55 ] . Clearly , other studies have found that IgG with neutralizing activity can prevent lentivirus infection after vaginal challenge [ 56 , 57 ] . Thus , whereas a strong vaccine - induced neutralizing IgG response may protect , nonneutralizing IgG or waning titers of neutralizing IgG present in an acidic lumen might enhance transcytosis across mucosal barriers while allowing infection of susceptible target cells . However , whether an antibody protects , enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity , the viral strain , the inflammatory state of the exposed individual , and genetic factors - such as FccR polymorphisms - that might influence antibody function [ 58 ] . Finally , if FcRn - mediated transcytosis applies in vivo , our results would strengthen the argument for a mucosal IgA response to vaccination - though not at the exclusion of a strong IgG neutralizing or other anti - viral response - since IgA can inhibit transcytosis , would not engage FcRn , and mediates only uni - directional translocation of immune complexes from the subepithelial space into external secretions [ 40 , 59 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 90}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 670, "end": 685}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 998}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1191, "end": 1212}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
