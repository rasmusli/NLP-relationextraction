Point mutations were counted individually while indels , irrespective of size , were counted as a single change [ 44 ] . There are several different ways to calculate sequence differences ( discussed in [ 50 ] ) , but this simple measure is sufficient for the purposes of this paper . Due to variations in technique among the various studies that produced these sequences , the ends of the alignment tended to be ragged . For this reason , we compared only the section of complete alignment between each sequence and the reference genome . The few internal reassortments [ 32 ] that have occurred in H1N1 were easily seen in the alignments , but these also made up a small fraction of all sites . We did our best to create a consistent alignment through these regions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
