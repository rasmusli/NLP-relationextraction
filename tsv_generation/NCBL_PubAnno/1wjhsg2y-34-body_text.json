In the absence of many primary studies on CoVs in bats from the region , our PubMed searches would have also identified publications that mention bats in the abstracts and titles , e . g . , of review papers [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] . Bat - CoV characterization from Saudi Arabia [ 40 ] and Lebanon [ 130 ] are two of the notable studies that reported primary results from on - the - ground virus surveillance efforts . More than half of the countries in Western Asia had no published research on bat - associated CoVs ( Table 1 ) , demonstrating a significant gap for a viral family that can cause severe morbidity in human and domestic animal populations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 230}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 348}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
