While documenting viral diversity and prevalence in reservoir host populations is a critical first step , assessing ecological and environmental factors that may influence host - virus dynamics in bat populations and promote transmission to incidental hosts , such as humans or domestic animals , is vital for developing effective surveillance initiatives . Host - virus dynamics are complex , and the emergence and spread of bat - associated viruses requires more than just the presence of a pathogen in a reservoir host but detailed knowledge of a host species ' ecology , behavior , reproduction , genetics , and life history traits [ 18 , 82 ] . Evidence suggests that many bat - associated viruses have a long history of co - evolution with their bat hosts [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] , further highlighting the importance of understanding both phylogenetic factors and environmental contact with other species to fully appreciate factors driving cross - species transmission [ 34 , 86 ] . Outbreaks of bat - associated viruses are commonly attributed to atypical interactions between bats and other wildlife species , domestic animals , and humans resulting from human - driven land - use change and encroachment . Shared threats to public health and wildlife conservation transcend national borders , and minimizing such threats will require transboundary collaborations among diverse experts . One multidisciplinary consortium , the Bat One Health Research Network ( BOHRN ) , is now addressing these important issues at a global scale by connecting bat experts and public health researchers to identify critical gaps in research [ 87 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 207}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 920}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1218, "end": 1224}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
