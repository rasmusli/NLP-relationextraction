[ 49 ] using nested PCR to amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene ( gltA ) [ 51 ] . Among the Bartonella - positive samples , we randomly selected 5 - 10 positive samples per site for Sanger sequencing ( n = 51 ) . PCR products were purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator Kits ( Zymo Research ) and sequenced in both directions at the Georgia Genomics Facility . Resulting chromatograms were checked for quality and trimmed using Geneious ( Biomatters ) [ 52 ] . Post - trimmed forward and reverse sequences were assembled to create 348 base pair ( bp ) consensus sequences for each sample ( n = 35 ; the quality of 16 chromatograms was too low ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
