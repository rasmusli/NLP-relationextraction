Racey [ 81 ] discusses a history of foreign - led bat research efforts in non - Western countries , where in many instances , neither permission nor consultation was requested from local researchers . Regarding bat research in Western Asia , there are numerous ways in which foreign organizations can support existing regional institutions . In - country field training , outreach development ( e . g . , scientific communication ) , and workshops that promote networking and idea exchange between experts and early career scientists including students , would provide local researchers with the skills and resources necessary to expand on - going research efforts [ 4 ] . To this end , WAB - Net aims to support local institutions by : ( 1 ) supporting in - region scientists in research topics that they identify as high - priority , ( 2 ) assisting young professionals and early career scientists in developing multidisciplinary research skills , ( 3 ) conducting all screening of diagnostic samples in regional laboratories to strengthen regional surveillance capacity ( currently including the Royal Scientific Society in Amman , Jordan and the R . Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi , Georgia ) , ( 4 ) sharing standardized protocols that will be translated into local languages and distributed widely within the region , and ( 5 ) engaging with regional policymakers to effectively communicate the relevance of the network ' s research , and encourage future funding of related efforts .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
