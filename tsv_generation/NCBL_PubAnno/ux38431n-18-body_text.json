Fig 1 and Table 3 show that HAdV - B and HAdV - C were the most prevalent . The strains isolated from Northern China were identified as HAdV - 3 ( n = 10 ) and HAdV - 7 ( n = 24 ) , belonging to HAdV - B ; HAdV - 1 ( n = 6 ) , HAdV - 2 ( n = 1 ) , HAdV - 5 ( n = 2 ) , HAdV - 6 ( n = 2 ) and HAdV - 57 ( n = 1 ) , belonging to HAdV - C ; and HAdV - 37 ( n = 1 ) , belonging to HAdV - D ( Table 4 ) . The genotypes of most HAdV isolates were identified by alignment to those prototypes from GenBank , with the exception of isolates KM377988 , KM377996 , KM378012 , KM378034 , and KM378038 , which formed a single separate cluster compared to prototypes HAdV - 2 and HAdV - 6 . HAdV - 37 and HAdV - 57 were also detected in respiratory specimens , which were reported as the pathogens of keratoconjunctivitis and gastrointestinal , respectively . In contrast , HAdV - C was predominant among the strains from Eastern China with HAdV - 1 ( n = 5 ) , HAdV - 2 ( n = 8 ) , HAdV - 5 ( n = 6 ) , and HAdV - 6 ( n = 1 ) , whereas HAdV - B also contained several strains from Eastern China with HAdV - 3 ( n = 2 ) and HAdV - 7 ( n = 1 ) , and HAdV - 4 ( HAdV - E ) . Table 5 , which indicated that dominant types for single HAdV infection was HAdV - 7 ( 3 cases ) , HAdV - 1 ( 3 cases ) and HAdV - 2 ( 2 cases ) . Based on the analysis of clinical records , the clinical manifestation of the patients with HAdV infection included fever , cough , and sputum . A few cases showed signs of a runny nose , nasal congestion , and gastrointestinal symptoms , such as diarrhoea and vomiting ( Table 5 ) . Because the prevalence of co - infection of HAdV with other viruses is higher than that of HAdV infection alone , it is difficult to associate the clinical profiles with HAdV infection or specific types .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 963}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
