{"cord_uid": "04q71md3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3930559", "divid": "27", "text": "By using models to predict the observed global emergence of pandemic H1N1 , we demonstrate that an approach that integrates passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information . Although the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large , it remains remarkable because we attempt to predict the spatial expansion of an epidemic lineage ( pandemic H1N1 ) from the seasonal dynamics of another lineage ( H3N2 ) and because the main process underlying the global dispersal of H3N2 influenza appears to be air travel itself . Passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric , thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread , which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of pandemic H1N1 . Investigations using more advanced simulation techniques , e . g . [ 35 ] , may be able to build upon the conceptual bridge between genetic data and epidemiological modeling implied by our findings . Future prediction efforts may also need to focus on alternative scenarios of spatial spread , as highlighted by the recent emergence of a novel avian influenza H7N9 lineage in China [ 36 ] . Should this virus evolve sustained human - to - human transmissibility , then airline - passenger data and flight routes from the outbreak regions in particular , would be able to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk . If the virus remains restricted to avian hosts , however , risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses ( perhaps based on predictors calibrated against H5N1 avian influenza ) may help to target H7N9 surveillance and control efforts . In conclusion , our framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 74}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 649}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 950}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1296, "end": 1317}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1663, "end": 1687}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1875, "end": 1895}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
