Total cellular proteins from different time points were separated by SDS - PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Whatman ) . The membranes were blocked with 5 % non - fat milk powder dissolved in tris - buffered saline , containing 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , for 2 h at room temperature . Primary antibodies ( see below ) were diluted 1 : 500 in blocking buffer and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 \u00b0 C . Next , the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 1 : 3000 for 2 h at room temperature . Detected proteins were revealed using the ECL Detection Kit ( KeyGen Biotech ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
