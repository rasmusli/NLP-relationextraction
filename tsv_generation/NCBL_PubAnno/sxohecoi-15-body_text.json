However , the effect of FcRnmediated transcytosis on IgG alone does not appear as strong as the effect on IgG immune complexes , where , for example , with complexes made with 50 mg / ml of VRC01 or 2F5 , there was about an 8 - fold increase in transcytosis under conditions allowing FcRn engagement . This difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of IgG by the epithelial cells at both pH 6 . 0 and pH 7 . 4 ; IgG thus internalized can engage FcRn in acidic endosomes and be shuttled to the basolateral side of the cells [ 41 ] . The internalization of immune complexes , on the other hand , likely depends primarily on FcRn engagement at the surface of the cell at pH 6 . 0 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
