The Annotation Support Server accepts either DNA or protein sequence as input and , depending on the user options , can either use existing gene calls or invoke standard gene callers ( e . g . , GLIMMER - 3 for protein - encoding genes ) . The server also houses newly developed high - performance methods to assign function to protein sequences or regions of genomic DNA sequences , based on FIGfams [ 22 ] . Below is an example application using these methods that produces a relatively accurate annotation of most microbial genomes within a few minutes . To evaluate the technology , users are encouraged to simply submit a known prokaryotic genome to the server for annotation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
