They None of the studies included in the reviews specifically addressed the role of outdoor air quality on indoor exposures , even though 90 % of EU citizens live in areas where the WHO guidelines for air quality for PM 2 . 5 is not met [ 10 ] . Neither was the existence of indoor air sources systematically analysed nor exposure levels quantified or considered when associating ventilation and health . Therefore the support from these previous studies on determining the best combination of source control and ventilation levels is limited . This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements . The methods presented here allow for informed health - based optimization of efforts aimed at reducing harmful exposures and improving health of the occupants . The results are intended for development of national and international guidelines and standards , and can also be used as background information when", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
