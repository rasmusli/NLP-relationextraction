Total RNA was collected 48 hours post - transfection and real time RT - qPCR was performed using CxCul4 primers . As a control , real time RT - qPCR was performed using CxRpL32 primers . Western blot was performed on duplicate cells to confirm transfection and protein expression using anti - V5 antibody ( S6 Fig ) . The results showed up - regulation of CxCul4 expression in cells transfected with WNV - NS1 ( 2 fold ) and WNV - NS5 ( 3 fold ) genes ( Fig 5A ) . This indicates NS1 and NS5 may be involved in upregulation of CxCul4 after WNV infection in Culex cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 132}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 723, "end": 727}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
