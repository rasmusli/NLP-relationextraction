RD cells were synchronized in G0 / G1 by serum starvation for 24 h , and then mock - infected or infected with EV - D68 Fermon strain for 2 h . The cells were then stimulated with 10 % FBS in order to trigger cell cycle re - entry into S phase from G0 / G1 . At 24 h of mitogenic stimulation with serum , the mock - infected cells progressed synchronously from G0 / G1 into S phase . In contrast , the majority of the EV - D68 - infected RD cells remained in G0 / G1 phase over the 24 h time period without S entry ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 3A ) . Therefore , these results support a model in which EV - D68 infection regulates the cell cycle by preventing entry into the S phase .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 177}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 615}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
