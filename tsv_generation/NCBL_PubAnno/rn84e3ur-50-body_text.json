The average infection risk of the seated passengers is 0 . 2015 , 0 . 2051 and 0 . 2096 for no human movement , moving speeds of 0 . 5 m / s and 1 . 0 m / s , respectively . The assessment result shows that human movement may increase the average infection risk in the cabin , especially for the passengers seated three rows ahead and one row behind the index patient . The likelihood of each case is estimated and the highest likelihood can be found in the no movement case with a quanta generation rate of 0 . 141 million . So in this SARS outbreak case , the effect of human movement on airborne disease transmission , as it changes the dispersion and mixing pattern of infectious expiratory aerosol , is found to be very insignificant . Since the numerical simulation and the risk assessment are case - dependent , this result may not be generalized to all cases . Moreover , if the seated passengers walk in the airplane cabin , the intake doses of that passengers may also significantly increase and lead to a high infection risks . So the movements of the seated passengers also have a strong influence on the airborne disease transmission in the airplane cabin and may result in significantly higher infection risks for the moving persons .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 653, "end": 658}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
