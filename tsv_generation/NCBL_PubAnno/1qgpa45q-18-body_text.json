A limitation of our sequencing method , as is common with amplicon sequencing protocols [ 26 , 27 ] , was absent coverage at the 3 \u2032 leader and 5 \u2032 trailer regions not captured by these primers . Our results demonstrate the application of amplicon sequencing to generate full length HMPV genomes directly from clinical samples . The observed diversity of the individual genes is comparable to that described previously [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . This method and data provide a useful reference for design of local molecular diagnostics and for studies aimed at understanding HMPV epidemiology and evolution in Africa .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
