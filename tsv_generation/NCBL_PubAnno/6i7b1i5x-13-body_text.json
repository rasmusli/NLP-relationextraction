Some , such as IgA nephropathy and rheumatoid pericarditis have shown plasma cell infiltration and IgA staining [ 89 ] . In KD it is proposed that these plasma cells mature in situ from initial B cell infiltration . Monoclonal B cell infiltrates have been shown in other disorders [ 90 ] . Additionally , in situ lymphoid neogenesis is described in numerous inflammatory and infectious disease systems [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] and some oncologic processes [ 95 , 96 ] . Localized inflammation and cellular damage may lead to exposure of previously hidden self - antigens setting off a localized autoimmune cascade [ 97 ] . From pure pathological studies , it is unclear if the clonality of the IgA + plasma cell infiltrates seen in KD represents a global inflammatory response or a specific antibody driven response against an invasive pathogen .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 136}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 220}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 260}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 288}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 321}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 361}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 389}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 457}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 724}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
