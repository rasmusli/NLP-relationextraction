If multiple animals were moved on the same day from one farm to another , this was treated as one movement ; markets were initially not explicitly included . Slaughterhouses were considered as sinks , and therefore movements to slaughterhouses were ignored even when going through a livestock market . In total , there were 70 243 farms and 327 markets in our dataset , with 856 454 movements in total . A total of 635 016 movements passed through markets , with 47 692 farms using cattle markets at least once during 2010 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 46}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
