More recently , a number of bespoke image analysis software programs have been developed to automatically compute CBF from video files captured using video microscopy [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . This software computes changes in pixel intensity over time ( as shown in Figure 1A ) to Hertz using fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) , a function that has been used frequently for this application [ 14 , 15 ] . However , the studies that describe this software lack two important elements : comparison of their results to the direct measurement of ciliary beat frequency from slow - motion video replay of cilia , and the measurement cilia that beat at very high frequencies [ 8 , 9 ] . This is important as some phenotypes of PCD display respiratory cilia that beat at frequencies above 16 Hz and brain ependymal cilia beat at frequencies higher than 36 Hz . In this paper , we describe software that was validated by comparing results to those obtained by direct measurement of high - speed video recordings of cilia . The program also runs using open - source software . To evaluate a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies we studied both human respiratory cilia and ependymal cilia from the rat brain . Respiratory cilia usually beat at less than 16 Hz [ 7 ] and brain cilia usually beat at over 36 Hz . To obtain CBF measurements above 16 Hz , we slowed the frequency at which ependymal cilia beat by adding the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin , which we have previously shown to reduce ependymal CBF [ 4 ] .
