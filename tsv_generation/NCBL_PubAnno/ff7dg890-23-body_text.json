The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1 / r and 1 / c , respectively , and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data . This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [ 36 ] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [ 33 ] . The relationship between estimated R 0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A . It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0 . In general , as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed ( increasing n ) , lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate k . On the other hand , as the variance in the latent period is reduced ( increasing m ) , higher values of R 0 are estimated . Indeed , we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle : if we ignore the latent period , then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection ' s basic reproductive ratio . When the latent period is included , however , this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large ( Figure 2B ) . In closely examining equation 4 , we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class ( 1 / r \u00bc 0 ) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included ( 1 / r . 0 ) ( see equation S1 in Protocol S1 ) . Therefore , when faced with a rapidly spreading infection , either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures ( such as mass vaccination ) that will be needed to control the epidemic . The effects of changing the distributions of the latent and infectious periods on the estimated value of R 0 , with k assumed to be 100 per year and the average latent and infectious periods fixed at 1 wk . The gray grid surfaces show the asymptotic values of R 0 when the latent and infectious periods are both exponentially distributed ( lower surface ) or fixed ( higher surface ) . We note that the shape of each surface is independent of the exact value of k . ( B ) At higher values of k , R 0 may be substantially over - or underestimated using the classical exponent distributed model ( n \u00bc m \u00bc 1 ) compared to periods of fixed lengths ( n \u00bc m ! ' ) , depending on whether an exposed class is included ( solid lines ) or not ( dashed lines ) . DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 0020174 . g002", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
