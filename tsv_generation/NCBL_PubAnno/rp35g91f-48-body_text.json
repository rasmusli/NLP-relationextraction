{"cord_uid": "rp35g91f", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5592927", "divid": "48", "text": "Of particular interest in our gene network is the expression of Cacna2d2 which codes for the a - 2 / d subunit of the voltage - dependent calcium channel complex , a subunit that is highly and predominantly expressed in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes ( Marionneau et al . 2005 ) . This gene is expressed at low levels in our gene network but is regulated from a suggestive eQTL on Chr1 : 33 ( one of the three loci from which our gene network is coregulated ) . Since expression of this subunit is associated with nodal tissues , upregulation of Cacna2d2 , subsequent to dysregulation of our gene network , could predispose to gain of pacemaker activity . In support of this , Cacna2d2 expression is reported to be highly sensitive to dosage of the transcription factor TBX5 ( Mori et al . 2006 ) , another gene in our extended gene network . TBX5 is an essential factor for development of the cardiac conduction system including the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches ( Arnolds et al . 2012 ; Mori et al . 2006 ; Moskowitz et al . 2004 ) . TBX5 has also been shown to interact and cooperate with both NKX2 - 5 ( Hiroi et al . 2001 ; Puskaric et al . 2010 ) and GATA4 ( Munshi et al . 2009 ) ( also in our gene network ) to drive commitment to a nodal cell phenotype ( Stefanovic et al . 2014 ) . Since NKX2 - 5 is known to suppress the nodal phenotype ( Ye et al . 2015 ) , a fine balance between TBX5 interactions with NKX2 - 5 vs . GATA4 may underlie the maintenance of the working myocardium in the pulmonary myocardium .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
