So far , IFITMs have been essentially studied in the context of target cells , where their overexpression induces a strong antiviral phenotype by trapping incoming viral particles in endosomes . This antiviral activity is broad and targets , albeit with different efficiency , a large panel of viruses including HIV - 1 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] . Here , we report that the presence of IFITMs in virus producing cells leads to the production of virions of decreased infectivity . In light of the largely membrane distribution of the different IFITMs their incorporation into retroviral particles is not surprising . The diverse spectrum of envelopes and of retroviruses on which IFITMs exert similar effects leads us the hypothesize that this mechanism of inhibition does not target a specific viral domain , but rather takes advantage of the manner in which HIV and more generally retroviruses assemble . In this respect , the membrane distribution of IFITMs strongly suggests that passive incorporation is the most plausible explanation for their packaging in retroviral particles . This incorporation does not seem to occur to the detriment of the one of Env , as IFITMs do not modify the Env to Gag ratio of virion particles ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
