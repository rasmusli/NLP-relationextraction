Vaccination seems to be an effective approach to reduce the occurrence of PWD and to reduce infection pressure and increase immunity in the pig population [ 2 ] . Several studies conducted in pigs confirm a reduction of antimicrobial usage after vaccination [ 95 ] . In fact , vaccination against the porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by Lawsonia intracellularis reduced the need for therapeutic oxytetracycline administration in Danish pigs [ 96 ] . Live attenuated and wild type avirulent E . coli vaccines appear to be promising for the control of ETEC infections and live vaccine against ETEC : F4 , is now available in Canada and Europe [ 97 ] . This vaccine is added to the drinking water and recommended for the vaccination of healthy weaned pigs of 17 days or more . Clinical studies confirmed that administration of this vaccine significantly reduced intestinal colonization by virulent ETEC : F4 and the accumulation of fluid in the intestines after an experimental challenge [ 98 ] . The immunity in piglets begins 7 days after oral vaccination , however , since PWD caused by ETEC : F4 occurs shortly , in the first week , after weaning , an immune trough may exist in the first days after weaning during which the pigs are not protected [ 97 ] . Thus , the time of the administration of this vaccine should be adjusted . In addition , clinical trials of vaccination against ETEC : F18 has been carried out in pigs . Genetically susceptible pigs were vaccinated orally on three consecutive days , beginning 10 days before weaning with a live F18ac - positive E . coli vaccine [ 53 ] . In this study , a significant rise in F18ac - specific serum IgA and a 3 Log CFU decrease in fecal shedding of the F18ac - positive challenge strain was observed compared to the unvaccinated group . However , this vaccine did not induce protective immunity against ETEC : F18 . On the other hand , it was shown that a minor subunit of F18 ( FedF ) alone or genetically fused to F4 FaeG subunit or conjugated to F4 fimbriae induced protective anti - F18 antibodies in pigs [ 99 ] . In general , the success of a vaccine against PWD depends largely on the identification of the most prevalent ETEC pathotype present in the farm , resulting in matching of the appropriate protective antigens with the adhesin produced by the ETEC present on the farm , and administering it at the optimal time [ 7 ] . For vaccines consisting of live F4 or F18ac - positive E . coli , it is often recommended to vaccinate suckling pigs to obtain a strong mucosal immunity production , IgA , before weaning . However , our knowledge is very limited about the effect of maternal antibodies on the survival of these vaccine strains in the intestine of pigs of this age . Also , there is no cross protection against ETEC strains expressing a different fimbria or toxin . Recently , plantbased vaccines for protection of pigs against ETEC were investigated . A rice - based cholera vaccine expressing the choleratoxin ( CT ) subunit B ( CTB ) ( MucoRice - CTB ) was tested in pigs for protection against LT - ETEC infection [ 100 ] . CTB - based vaccines can target not only F4 - type but also F18 - type ETECs , and this vaccine also induced maternal CTB - specific IgG and IgA in the colostrum and milk of sows after farrowing . CTB - specific antibodies were also secreted into the gut lumen of weaned pigs and reduced intestinal loop fluid accumulation upon ETEC challenge , indicating a protective effect of this vaccine against ETEC diarrhea [ 100 ] . However , the cost of these vaccines is very high and , unlike open - air farming , the production of transgenic plants for biotherapeutic use is very demanding . Moreover , the procedures for manufacturing and processing of plant - based pharmaceuticals are not well defined . Thus , a large - scale production of these vaccines not envisaged , at least in the near future . Current progress in the development of subunit vaccines against ETEC associated with diarrhea in humans and animals has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 97 , 101 ] . However , none of these subunit vaccines has been marketed in swine .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 374}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 666}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 854, "end": 870}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1377, "end": 1381}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
