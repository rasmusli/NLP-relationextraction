Some of this literature assigned the blame and responsibility , for the outbreak , to people ' s cultures ( Dong 2008 ; Morinet et al . 2016 ) , which oversimplifies complex issues that result from complex processes , such as globalization , climate change , and global economics . This kind of narrative reflects the politics of blame , which typically attributes responsibility for the sources of the outbreak to a cultural minority group and neglects the influence of colonialism and the social determinants of health , including overcrowding , poor sanitation , and poverty that increase these people ' s vulnerability ( Dry and Leach 2010 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
