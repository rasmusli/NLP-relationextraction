It provides a graphical , drag - and - drop interface to allow users to design and execute ad - hoc workflows . Workflows are constructed by an end - user by inter - connecting functional blocks , called components . A component is a piece of independent and self - contained code performing a given functionality on its input and generates an output . Data paths among components can be specified by drawing lines between / among the output ( s ) and input ( s ) of different components , respectively . Thereby , various combinations of these components ( such as one output to multiple inputs , multiple outputs to multiple inputs ) can be used to create any workflow depicting the flow of both data and logic .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
