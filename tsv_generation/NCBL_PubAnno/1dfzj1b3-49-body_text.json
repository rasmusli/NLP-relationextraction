Recently , in our bibliographic research , some examples could be found [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] . Sometimes , the decision of only using this method can be attributed to the low antioxidant activity detected , therefore the authors consided it unnecessary to pursue other methods . One example is the case reported in [ 61 ] , in which the authors found low antioxidant activities of Commiphora ornifolia ( Balf . f . ) Gillett and Commiphora parvifolia Engl . oils even at high concentrations . According to these results along with the chemical composition of the oils , in which phenolic compounds were absent , the authors probably considered it unnecessary to use other methods . Another example is the oil of leaves of Olea europaea L . cv . Chemlali from Tunisia that also possesses low activity when compared to BHT [ 70 ] , because the main components were \u03b1 - pinene and 2 , 6 - dimethyloctane , that is , non - phenolic compounds .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
