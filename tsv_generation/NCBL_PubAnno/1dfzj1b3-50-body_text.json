For example , the authors in [ 62 ] found high antioxidant activities of the essential oils of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh . growing wild in different localities of Sardinia ( Italia ) . The activities changed according to the chemical composition , neverthless generally constituted by p - cymene , 1 , 8 - cineole , \u03b2 - phellandrene , spathulenol and cryptone in different proportions according to the harvesting place and period . The essential oil of Majorana hortensis L . had appreciable antioxidant activity probably ascrible to carvacrol with positive synergism with other components [ 66 ] . Citrus maxima Burm . and Citrus sinensis ( L . ) Osbeck also had considerable antioxidant activities , despite the chemical differences of their essential oils . Whereas Citrus sinensis oils was predominantly constituted by limonene , in Citrus maxima oil , several components could be identified in significant amounts in the oil ( limonene , E - citral , Z - citral and 3 , 3dimethyl - 1 - hexene [ 67 ] . Heracleum pastinacifolium and Heracleum persicum were described as possessing moderate antioxidant activity , which main components were myristicin and trans - amethole , respectively [ 68 ] . Three Mexican Lippia graveolens Kunth . oils with different chemical compositions as well as their microcapsules were evaluated in terms of antiradical activities . The authors concluded that microencapsulation increased the anti - radical activity from fourfold to eightgold [ 69 ] . Diverse oils obtained from Origanum vulgare L . subsp . glandulosum ( Desf . ) collected at different locations of Tunisia showed different but always good abilities for scavenging DPPH radicals . Such results depended on the percentage of phenolic compounds ( thymol ) present in the oils [ 71 ] . In spite of the fact some authors consider that the flower oils of Retama raetam ( Forssk . ) Webb cultivated in Tunisia presented good antioxidant activity , as measured through the DPPH method , the sole method used by the authors , whereby the IC 50 value was fortyfold superior to that of the reference BHT , nevertheless the apparent relative good activity reported by the authors could be attributed to the relative high percentage of monoterpenes present in the essential oils [ 72 ] . A good activity was found by Saei - Dehkordi et al . ( 2010 ) [ 74 ] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum ( L . ) Moris from Tunisia , because the IC 50 values were close to that of BHT . Such antiradical activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl - propanoids , dillapiole and myristicin [ 60 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
