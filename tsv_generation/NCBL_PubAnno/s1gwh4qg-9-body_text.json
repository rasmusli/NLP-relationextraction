The user submits sequence IDs , defines a format of conversion , and selects a database to be searched . Currently available databases include GenBank / RefSeq / GenPept , UniProt , EMBL , SeqHound and EnsEMBL ( Gene and Transcripts divisions for Human sequences ) . SNAD extracts IDs from the input and queries the database with these IDs to locate associated annotation . After retrieving annotation , SNAD designs names according to a name template that defines name structure and annotationbased content for submitted entries . The final step of the SNAD - mediated processing is substitution of submitted IDs in the input with the designed names to return results to the user .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
