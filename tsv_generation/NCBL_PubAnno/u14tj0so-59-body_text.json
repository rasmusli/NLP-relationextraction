Iterative HFold continues to be significantly superior to HFold until approximately 90 % of G big is available , after which HFold is more accurate . Iterative HFold is most successful when little information about G big is known because it can add both pseudoknot - free and pseudoknotted base pairs . In particular , using methods 3 and 4 ( see Section ' Iterative HFold ' ) Iterative HFold first finds a low energy pseudoknot - free structure that includes the given input structure ( by extending the stems of the given structure ) , and then adds pseudoknotted base pairs to further lower the energy of the overall structure . However , when the vast majority of base pairs of G big are provided as input , HFold dominates as it keeps the base pairs of the input structure , thereby often adding base pairs of G small . When 100 % of G big is provided as input , HFold ' s bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval is ( 85 . 74 % , 91 . 87 % ) , compared with ( 79 . 36 % , 87 . 41 % ) for Iterative HFold .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
