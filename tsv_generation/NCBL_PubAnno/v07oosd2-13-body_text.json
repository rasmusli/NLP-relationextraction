Indeed , Laine and collaborators reported that in Finland , the increase in pig ' s herd size was associated with a higher risk of PWD in pigs [ 38 ] . While , in Canada , Amezuca et al . [ 43 ] reported that PWD occurred on a variety of farm types and sizes . However , a link between stocking density and PWD was described in pig ' s farms in some countries [ 30 , 44 ] . Mixing piglets from different farms is a common practice in pig husbandry , particularly at weaning . This mixing can result in fighting as the pigs strive to establish dominance relationships , with most aggressive interactions being typically shown during the first few hours after grouping [ 45 ] . It has been reported that the hierarchical behaviour among pigs leads to very significant differences in food and water consumption on farms [ 46 ] . Production based on segregated sow parities was proposed as a solution to reduce the impact of the social hierarchy . This system of grouping according to the sow ' s farrowing rank reduces disease challenge by reducing variation in the immune status of the piglets [ 47 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 115}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 260}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 334, "end": 338}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 436}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
