In the present study , an analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in the extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H . littoralis . The separation was achieved using a reversed - phase column . The method was found to be accurate , repeatable , and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples . The highest lycorine content was found in the bulb extract ( 2 . 54 \u00b1 0 . 02 g / mg ) whereas the least was in the root extract ( 0 . 71 \u00b1 0 . 02 g / mg ) of the wild plants . Few callus culture samples had high content of lycorine , comparable to that of wild plants . The results showed that plant growth regulators , 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4 - D ) alone at 4 . 5 M ( 2 . 58 \u00b1 0 . 38 g / mg ) or a combination of 2 , 4 - D at 9 . 00 M with 4 . 5 M of 6 - benzylaminopurine ( BAP ) , were the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine ( 2 . 45 \u00b1 0 . 15 g / mg ) content in callus culture . The present analytical method could be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the tissue culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H . littoralis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
