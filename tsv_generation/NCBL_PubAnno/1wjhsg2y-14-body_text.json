Such approaches are necessary to proactively detect and minimize the emergence and impact of zoonotic diseases . To be effective , a One Health research agenda must synergize with individual experts in bat ecology , physiology , behavior , and genetics , as well as linking in with experts across veterinary and human health sciences . One approach to most efficiently leverage this collective expertise and quickly share knowledge across scientific disciplines is to tap into existing scientific networks . The multiple bat research networks of the world ( Figure 1 ) pose a unique resource and opportunity in this regard . However , these networks currently have differing levels of coordination , resources , and active participation , making this approach more difficult in some geographic areas . Creating a combined bat conservation and infectious disease research network de novo would allow for full integration of these two disciplines from the start by supporting efforts to conserve bat populations and their critical roosting and foraging habitats and helping to safeguard human health from bat - associated viruses . Western Asia is the only contiguous block of countries that currently lacks an organized network of bat researchers ( Figure 1 ) , representing a conservation void in terms of global bat conservation [ 4 ] and an opportunity to integrate initiatives to proactively monitor public health through virus surveillance .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 338}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1070, "end": 1089}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
