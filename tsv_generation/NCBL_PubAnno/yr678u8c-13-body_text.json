This may provide an explanation for some of the earlier experimental discrepancies . Further work in this study demonstrated that LC3 puncta were still observed in MHV infected ATG7 \u2212 / \u2212 cells , where LC3I to LC3II conversion cannot occur and also in cells expressing LC3 that cannot be processed to LC3II ( LC3 G120A ) . In addition , although the absence of the complete autophagy pathway due to a lack of ATG7 did not alter MHV replication , reduced expression of LC3 by RNAi did significantly reduce virus replication . Furthermore , viral protein expression could be rescued in the presence of LC3 G120A [ 56 ] . This demonstrated that MHV replication does not require the complete autophagy pathway , or conversion of LC3I to LC3II , in agreement with previous work , but instead required LC3I [ 52 ] . Interestingly , MHV RTCs co - localise with markers for cellular EDEMosomes [ 56 , 57 ] , vesicles involved in ER associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) tuning and knockdown of EDEMosome cargo receptor SEL1L reduced virus replication [ 57 , 58 ] . In the ERAD pathway , unfolded proteins are removed from the ER and targeted for degradation . However , under normal conditions , the ERAD machinery must be regulated to prevent premature removal of proteins before they have been folded [ 59 ] . During ERAD tuning , parts of the ERAD machinery are removed from the ER in EDEMosomes to down regulate the pathway [ 57 , 58 , 60 ] . LC3I is recruited to EDEMosomes by transmembrane protein SEL1L [ 57 ] and possibly acts as a coat protein [ 60 ] . This work has highlighted a role for LC3 as part of the ERAD tuning pathway , but not autophagy , in the replication of MHV . Whether this pathway is involved in the replication cycles of other coronaviruses remains to be determined .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 94}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
