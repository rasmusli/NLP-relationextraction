They are aromatic oily liquids , volatile , characterized by a strong odour , rarely coloured , and generally with a lower density than that of water . They can be synthesized by all plant organs ( flowers , buds , seeds , leaves , twigs , bark , herbs , wood , fruits and root ) and therefore extracted from these parts , where they are stored in secretory cells , cavities , canals , epidermic cells or glandular trichomes [ 2 , 3 ] . Essential oils only represent a small fraction of plant ' s composition ; nevertheless they confer the characteristics by which aromatic plants are used in the food , cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [ 4 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
