This hypothesis is supported by the finding that IFITMs can interact between themselves , although the extent of this multimerization has not been fully examined [ 49 ] . Whether these mechanisms are at play here and more importantly whether the same mechanism / s of inhibition is at play in target cells and in virion particles remains to be determined .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
