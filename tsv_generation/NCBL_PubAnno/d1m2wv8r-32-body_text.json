Full - scan MS mode ( 350 \u2212 1800 m / z ) was operated at a resolution of 70 , 000 , with an automatic gain control target of 1 \u00d7 10 6 ions and a maximum ion transfer of 60 ms . The precursor ions were fragmented by high - energy collisional dissociation and subjected to MS / MS scans with the following parameters : resolution , 17 , 500 ; automatic gain control , 5 \u00d7 10 6 ions ; maximum ion transfer , 70 ms ; intensity threshold , 5 , 000 ; and normalised collision energy , 29 % .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
