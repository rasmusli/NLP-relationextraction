Primers were designed to be as sensitive to target strain variants as possible , while still being specific enough to not cross - react with non - targets . Sensitivity was achieved by targeting regions of high sequence similarity , identified through a Multiple Sequence Alignment ( MSA ) of the target sequences . Specificity was achieved by targeting regions that do not appear to be similar to any other organisms , determined by searching a database of known genome sequences . Primer candidates were selected based on the combined results of the MSA and sequence searches . This technique is a modified version of the approach outlined in Slezak et . al . [ 16 ] , which accommodates degenerate primer design for diverse target genomes , and places a lower relative priority on primer uniqueness as compared to other known genomes . For rabies virus , which lacks perfect primer - length conservation around the genomic regions of interest , it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for many non - conserved primer regions . From the identified primer candidate regions , which included both perfectly conserved regions and degenerate regions , individual primer pairs were selected which provided overlapping coverage of the DNA being sequenced . Final checks were performed which helped avoid hybridization problems such as primer dimerization .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 40}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 957}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
