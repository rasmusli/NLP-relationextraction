Immunoprecipitation was performed using Pierce Crosslink IP kit ( Thermo Scientific ) following manufacturer ' s protocol . Briefly , cells were lysed using lysis buffer and after preclearing were incubated with anti - ubiquitin antibody ( Abcam ) crosslinked to beads in column for 18 hours . Flow - through was collected and immunoprecipitate was eluted using elution buffer . The samples were separated on polyacrylamide gel and Western blot was performed using anti - ubiquitin and anti - CxSTAT antibodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
