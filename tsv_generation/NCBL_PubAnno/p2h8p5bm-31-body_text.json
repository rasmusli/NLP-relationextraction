Over the last 17 years , viperin has gained lot of attention and was shown to exhibit broad antiviral activity [ 158 ] . Viperin is also known as one of the most highly upregulated genes after viral infection [ 146 , 159 ] . Within the family of flaviviridae , viperin has been shown to inhibit several members , such as WNV [ 160 ] , DENV [ 161 ] , ZIKV [ 162 ] , hepatitis C virus [ 163 ] , and TBEV [ 86 , 141 , 149 , 150 ] . Viperin is an iron sulphur protein with three domains ; a N - terminus amphipathic alpha - helix which mediates the intracellular localization to the ER , a S - adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) radical domain [ 158 , 164 , 165 ] homologous to a family of proteins that use SAM as a cofactor [ 166 ] , and a highly conserved C - terminal domain , important for iron sulphur ( Fe / S ) maturation [ 149 , 167 ] . Although viperin is able to inhibit several different viruses , the mechanism of action , the important motif in viperin and the step of viral life cycle inhibited differs for different viruses [ 158 ] . Viperin interacts with many viral and host factors for its antiviral function . TBEV replication is strongly inhibited by viperin , our research shows that viperin has no effect on the binding or entry of TBEV . However , viperin targets genome replication , packaging , and release of TBEV ( Figure 3 ) [ 86 , 149 , 150 ] . Viperin specifically targets the plus - sense RNA synthesis with no significant effect on the negative - sense RNA of TBEV during genomic replication [ 149 ] . Viperin ' s Fe / S maturation is dependent on Ciao1 [ 149 , 167 ] . The Fe / S cluster and a functional SAM domain of viperin is essential to inhibit the synthesis of the plus - sense RNA of TBEV [ 149 ] . However , the target for the radical SAM activity important for the antiviral activity of TBEV is currently unknown . The structure of viperin was recently characterized [ 168 ] , and based on similarities to other radical SAM enzymes , several different hypothesis have been put forward regarding the substrate of viperin and its antiviral activity [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] . However , none of these have shown importance in the context of mammalian viral infection . Although the exact mode of action against TBEV is not well understood , recent data indicates that viperin interacts with several viral proteins ; both structural prM and E and non - structural NS2A , NS2B , and NS3 . These interactions lead to a viperin - NS3 dependent degradation of viral proteins . The degradation of TBEV NS3 was shown to be proteasome dependent [ 150 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Interestingly , IFN treatment induces an increase of TBEV capsid particles and this effect was found to be dependent on viperin . Viperin mediated this effect by interacting , via its N - terminus , with the cellular protein Golgi Brefeldin A resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 ( GBF1 ) [ 86 ] . GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and essential in the life cycle of many RNA viruses , which utilize vesicular trafficking in their replication cycle and assembly process [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Viperin targets the NS3 protein for proteasomal degradation which inhibits the synthesis of + strand RNA . Furthermore , NS3 interacts with E , NS2A , and NS2B and these proteins are degraded by viperin in a NS3 - dependent manner . Viperin also interferes with particle assembly by inducing secretion of C particles in a COPII - dependent manner , independent of COPI . Viperin mediates this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1 .
