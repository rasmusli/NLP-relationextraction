Figure 3 presents result of time comparison between Iterative HFold and HotKnots in a log plot ( when log is in base 10 ) . The X axis shows log ( time ) for HotKnots data points and the Y axis shows log ( time ) for Iterative HFold on the HK - PK data set . RNA sequences in this data set are between 26 and 400 bases long . HFold runs significantly faster than HotKnots and finishes under 1 . 5 seconds for even the longest RNA sequence in our data set ( 400 bases ) . HotKnots is faster than Iterative HFold on sequences of up to 47 bases , where Iterative HFold starts being faster than HotKnots . Iterative HFold runs in less than 8 . 3 seconds for all RNA sequences in this data set whereas HotKnots runs for over 6000 seconds ( about 1 . 7 hours ) on the longest RNA sequence in our data set . information about performance of each method see Additional file 4 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
