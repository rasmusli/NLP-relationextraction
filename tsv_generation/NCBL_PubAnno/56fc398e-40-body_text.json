When markets do not contribute to disease transmission , only a very small percentage of nodes needs to be sampled using the TNS method . However , when we make the assumption that all batches on a market are well mixed , a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled . We also find that in this case , the RMS method requires sampling of a much smaller percentage of movements than the nonmarket scenario . This is unsurprising - markets represent very highly connected nodes in the network , and therefore when they are explicitly included in the model , an RMS approach will preferentially sample movements to and from these highly connected nodes . The model currently assumes that livestock do not stay overnight on markets , in line with Defra policy , and hence any infectious markets would become susceptible the following day . Should this not be the case , the role of markets in disease transmission may be slightly altered . Therefore , our results suggest that a more thorough , disease - specific analysis of the precise role of markets in disease transmission would be required in the future in order to determine context - specific optimal sampling strategies . However , our sensitivity analysis shows that TNS is the preferred sampling strategy for all studied transmission rates and infectious periods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
