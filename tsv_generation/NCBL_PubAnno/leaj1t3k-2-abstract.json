The key obstacle to the development of new antiviral agents is their delivery into infected cells in vi vo . Cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) are short peptides that can cross the cellular lipid bilayer with the remarkable capability to shuttle conjugated cargoes into cells . CPPs have been successfully utilized to enhance the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of antiviral molecules , and thereby increase the inhibitory activity of potential antiviral proteins and oligonucleotide analogues , both in cultured cells and in animal models . This review will address the notable findings of these studies , highlighting some promising results and discussing the challenges CPP technology has to overcome for further clinical applications .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 15}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
