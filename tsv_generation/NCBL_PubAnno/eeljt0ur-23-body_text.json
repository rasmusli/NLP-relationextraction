Crude fiber analysis was 2 . 22 % in Diet A and 3 . 16 % in Diet B . Total dietary fiber and the soluble and insoluble fractions were not analyzed in this study . These data would have helped to better characterize the dietary fiber composition of the diets ; however , ingredient composition provides some insight as to how these two diets differ . Diet A utilized dried beet pulp , fructooligosaccharides , and mannanoligosaccharides , while Diet B utilized powdered cellulose followed by dried beet pulp . Based on the ingredient composition , Diet A would be expected to provide more fermentable fibers and prebiotics that may have promoted an increased production of total intraluminal short - chain fatty acids and positively influenced microbial populations ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) ( 24 ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) ( 27 ) ( 28 ) ( 29 ) ( 30 ) . While dietary fiber and prebiotics are generally considered to provide benefits primarily within the large intestine and aid in the management of diarrhea , recent studies have demonstrated immune modulating benefits that could have broader benefits , particularly in conditions with an inflammatory nature ( 31 , 32 ) . The time required to see potential clinical benefits is unclear , and clinical improvement related to immunomodulation may require more than 1 - 2 weeks of dietary intervention . Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of the microbiota in inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and the potential benefits of dietary fibers and prebiotics in animals with chronic gastroenteropathies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1552}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1628, "end": 1656}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
