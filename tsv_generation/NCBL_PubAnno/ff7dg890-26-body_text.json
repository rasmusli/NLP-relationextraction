Depending on the precise details , inappropriate model selection may give rise to either gross over - or underestimates for the basic reproductive ratio of an infection . However , even when parameter estimates are reliable , choice of model structure can also be very important when making recommendations concerning individual - level control strategies . Historically , it has been shown that contact tracing and the effective quarantine of infected individuals and those potentially exposed is an important means of infection management [ 13 , 39 , 40 ] . We introduce both these measures into the SEIR epidemic model , assuming that there is a small delay in detecting newly infectious individuals , which may represent an asymptomatic phase or uncertainty in diagnosing symptoms ( see Methods and Protocol S1 ) . As we show in Figure 4 , the precise levels of isolation of infected individuals and of quarantining contacts required to control the outbreak and the predicted level of disease incidence are crucially affected by whether the classic exponentially distributed SEIR model or a more realistic framework is used .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
