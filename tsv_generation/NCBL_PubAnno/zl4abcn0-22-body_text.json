Different concentrations of acetic acid ranging from 0 . 25 to 1 % and formic acid ranging from 0 . 25 to 0 . 5 % were added into the mobile phase . In addition , the aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1 % ammonium acetate buffer . It was found that 1 % ammonium acetate buffer without any addition of acetic acid or formic acid was the optimum mobile phase for separation of lycorine . Therefore , the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile - 1 % ammonium acetate ( 15 : 85 v / v ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
