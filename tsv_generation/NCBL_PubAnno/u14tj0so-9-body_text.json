In a comprehensive comparison performed by Puton et al . [ 44 ] on the performance of publicly available non - comparative RNA secondary structure prediction methods that can handle pseudoknotted structures , IPknot ranks first for general length RNA sequences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
