These \" early response protooncogene \" products dimerize to form the AP - 1 transcription factor , a converging point that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation , differentiation , transformation , inflammation , pulmonary defense , and autoregulation of AP - 1 gene transcription [ 46 ] . Early studies [ 47 , 48 ] suggested that c - Jun had a role in early events in the pathogenesis of lung cancers because it was highly expressed in 31 - 50 % of patients with nonsmall cell cancers , and it was also upregulated in atypical bronchial epithelium . One study showed a transgenic mouse model directing conditional expression of the dominant - negative c - Jun mutant TAM67 in lung epithelial cells decreased tumor number and overall lung tumor burden in chemically induced mouse lung tumor models [ 49 ] . c - Jun is an important transcriptional activator of PDK1 . Notably , expression of PDK1 is sufficient to restore tumor growth after c - Jun knockdown in melanoma cells , suggesting that PDK1 is an important mediator of c - Jun oncogenic activities [ 50 ] . Consistent with this , we found that PGE 2 increased the expression of c - Jun and exogenous overexpression of c - Jun enhanced bronchial epithelial cells proliferation and expression of PDK1 , whereas inhibition by PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA caused inhibitions of cell growth and expression of PDK1 . This suggests that c - Jun is an upstream regulator of PDK1 signaling . Induction of c - Jun by PGE 2 regulates the expression and activation of PDK1 and cell growth . It indicated c - Jun might play an important role in the potential mechanism of abnormal cell proliferation in brochial epithelial cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 643}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 705, "end": 727}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 956}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 986}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1021, "end": 1032}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1202, "end": 1211}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
