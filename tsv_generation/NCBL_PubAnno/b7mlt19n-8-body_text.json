We found a correlation between the total number of putative LIR motifs identified in a family and number of sequences ( Fig . 2A ) . On average , we found 8 . 3 LIR motifs per sequence . The fact that viral sequences often refer to polyproteins instead of individual proteins is possibly an explanation of the high proportion of patterns identified .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
