One Health networks , in particular , often foster multidisciplinary research that relies on the transfer of knowledge and skills between its members and across disciplines for their success . In - service trainings , particularly through the sharing of best practices and standardized protocols and hands - on training , are meant to provide network members with an operational level of understanding on various subject matters , such that research activities can be replicated across both space and time . The WAB - Net currently consists of two programs designed to equip network members with a diverse set of skills . The first is \" in - field trainings , \" where local scientists are trained by expert bat disease ecologists on how to properly don and remove personal protective equipment ( PPE ) ; safely capture , handle , and identify local bat species ; and obtain non - lethal diagnostic samples ( e . g . , saliva , feces , blood , urine ) for virus detection . The second is a \" field - to - laboratory \" research exchange , designed to expose local scientists to every aspect of a multidisciplinary research project ( ranging from field collection to laboratory methods to statistical and phylogenetic analyses ) . This is especially helpful in providing researchers of a given discipline ( e . g . , bat ecology , virology , epidemiology ) with a more complete view of what a cross - disciplinary research project entails . Together , these trainings will promote collaboration and creativity , and provide participants with the skills and perspectives needed to better approach interdisciplinary One Health research .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 862}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
