Four hypotheses have been suggested for transmission of H5N1 in the HPAI outbreaks in Japan [ 6 ] : ( 1 ) H5N1 - virus - infected chickens may have been imported from other countries , ( 2 ) materials ( e . g . , vehicles and egg containers ) from infected area may have been used , ( 3 ) viruses may have been carried on clothes , boots , hands , and so forth , and ( 4 ) infected wild birds may have carried H5N1 virus into poultry farms to infect chickens . In particular , it has been suggested that migratory birds carried the viruses and subsequently infected domestic and / or wild ducks [ 9 ] . HPAI outbreaks in Japan . Therefore , it is very likely that the 2004 epidemics H5N1 virus was transmitted to Japan from East Asian countries . The important question is how could the H5N1 virus be transmitted from virus - positive migratory wild birds to domestic poultry in Japan ? We have noted that it is unlikely that wild birds directly transmitted influenza viruses to poultry in Japan , because all of the Japanese poultry farms , where H5N1 virus outbreaks occurred , had fowling nets in place to prevent entry of wild birds . However , flying insects ( e . g . , flies ) can easily get through the nets and invade a poultry farm . We have shown that a chicken can eat all 31 blow flies put inside its cage in just 7 min [ 10 ] . A chicken can catch and break down the body of a fly and even catch and swallow a fly in flight . Therefore , we have been interested in whether , if a chicken eats blow flies carrying H5N1 virus , the chickens might become infected and develop symptoms of H5N1 influenza .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 61}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 216}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 751}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1101, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1191, "end": 1202}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1742, "end": 1757}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
