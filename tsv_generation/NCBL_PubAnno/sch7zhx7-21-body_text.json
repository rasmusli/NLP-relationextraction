In addition to 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutants , we generated a 2A 29K / 3C 52R double mutant . After confirming the presence of the mutations , we generated an infectious virus and measured the virus titer over several rounds of replication . Vero cells were treated with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left untreated for four days prior to infection at MOI 0 . 01 . Cellular supernatant samples were collected and titered via plaque assay . As shown in Figure 2A , all viruses in untreated conditions replicated with similar kinetics and to similar levels regardless of protease mutation . However , in DFMO - treated cells , the wildtype CVB3 exhibited significant reductions in titer , which persisted to 72 hpi . Interestingly , the protease mutants , either alone or in combination , exhibited a significant rescue in viral titer compared to the wildtype virus , suggesting partial resistance to polyamine depletion .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
