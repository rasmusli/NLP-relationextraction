One of Iterative HFold ' s underlying methods is HFold - PKonly , which given the input structure only adds pseudoknotted base pairs . HFold - PKonly is especially useful for cases when the user has either complete information about the true pseudoknot - free structure or wants to check whether a single stem of the input structure can be part of a pseudoknot since , if the input structure only has the specific stem in question , the output structure of HFold - PKonly will determine if the given stem can be part of a pseudoknot .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
