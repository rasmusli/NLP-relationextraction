According to experimental measurements of cough droplets , the quantity of the droplets smaller than 3 \u03bcm was quite small , and the droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm might fall down to the ground immediately after they were expelled [ 33 , 34 ] . So in this work , the original size range of the aerosols was 3 \u03bcm ~ 112 \u03bcm and ten size classes were used to simulate the size distribution . In enclosed environment , the evaporation effects will strongly influence the size and mass of the droplets [ 32 ] . Considering that the equilibrium diameter after evaporation was 50 % of the original size [ 35 ] , the size range of the aerosol injections was 1 . 5 ~ 56 \u03bcm and the size distribution followed the experimental results given by Duguid [ 34 ] . The particles number of each size class was set as 50 , 000 and the total number of the particles of the ten size classes was 500 , 000 , follows the aerosol setup used by previous studies [ 18 , 22 ] . The total volume of this computational geometry is larger than that of Reference [ 22 ] ( 30 m 3 ) and smaller than that of Reference [ 18 ] ( 97 m 3 ) , thus the total number of the particles used in this numerical simulation can be considered as enough for this study . This number would be converted to the original number according to the size distribution of cough for infection risk assessment . The size distribution of the droplets used in the numerical simulation is shown in Table 3 . The coughing direction was 45 degree downwards ( 0 , 1 , \u2212 1 ) . When the index patient coughs , the open area of his mouth was 9 . 68 cm 2 . The velocity of the exhaled airflow was set according to the experimental results to approximately simulate a cough [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
