The structure of the unliganded pAPN was used to determine the structures of amino acid - soaked pAPN . Objective Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated in the absence of amino acids and showed strong electron density for each of the amino acids ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . Based on these maps , the models of amino acids were built , and the models of pAPN / amino acid complexes were further refined . Crystallographic statistics can be found in Supplemental Figure 5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
