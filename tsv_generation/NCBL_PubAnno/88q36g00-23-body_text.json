Briefly , the apparatus consisted of a black Plexiglas rectangular box and two identical clear Plexiglas cylinders . There were three interconnected chambers in the box . The light was conditioned at 20 lux in an experimental room . During the habituation phase , empty cylinders were placed in each of the end chambers . A mouse was introduced to the center chamber and its behavioral approach to the end chambers was monitored for 10 min . During the sociability test , an unfamiliar male ICR ( CD - 1 ) mouse ( stranger 1 ) that had no prior contact with the test mouse was placed in one of the empty chambers , and the behavioral approach of the test mouse to the empty chamber and stranger 1 was monitored for 10 min . During the social novelty test , a new unfamiliar male ICR ( CD - 1 ) mouse ( stranger 2 ) was placed in the third chamber , and the behavioral approach of the test mouse to stranger 1 and stranger 2 was monitored for 10 min . The time spent in each zone was calculated using the Ethovision automated tracking program ( Noldus , Wageningen , The Netherlands ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
