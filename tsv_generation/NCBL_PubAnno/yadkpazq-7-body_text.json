In vitro , the prototype of CpG - A , ODN 2216 [ 12 ] , strengthened the antiviral qualities of feline immune cells and stimulated their production of soluble molecules that inhibited the replication of five different families of viruses : Coronaviridae , Herpesviridae , Caliciviridae , Parvoviridae , and Retroviridae . In vivo , ODN 2216 induced a systemic antiviral state .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
