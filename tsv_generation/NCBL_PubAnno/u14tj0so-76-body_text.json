To investigate the degree to which the energy model may be causing mis - predictions by HotKnots V2 . 0 or Iterative HFold , we considered the degree to which the maximum accuracy structures produced by these methods , i . e . , the structure with highest F - measure , is better than the minimum free energy structures . Similarly , if we compare the maximum accuracy structure output by Iterative HFold with the minimum free energy structure , whether given HotKnots hotspots or the first 50 suboptimal structures to Iterative HFold as input , the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence intervals of average F - measure also show improvement - see Table 6 . The difference in improvements is significant in all but one case , namely Iterative HFold on hotspots structures as input for pseudoknotted structures of the HK - PK data set . We conclude that improvements on the energy parameter values for pseudoknotted structures may further improve accuracy of both HotKnots and Iterative HFold .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
