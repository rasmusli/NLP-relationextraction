DU145 and PC3 cells were washed with PBS and harvested mechanically with a cell scraper . A total of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells were incubated with 500 nmol / L cyc - LHSPW - ( Gly ) 4 - FITC or anti - CD13 antibody ( 22A5 - FITC , Miltenyi ) for 60 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C . Stained samples and controls were assayed on a BD Facscalibur . Tumor sections frozen in OCT medium were sectioned at a thickness of 7 \u03bcm and briefly fixed in cold acetone for 10 min . After rinsing in PBS , the sections were stained with 250 nM cyc - LHSPW - ( Gly ) 4 - FITC overnight at 4 \u00b0 C . The sections were washed with PBS and mounted with DAPI Prolong Gold . The slides were visualized using a Nikon 6D High Throughput Epifluorescence Microscope .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
