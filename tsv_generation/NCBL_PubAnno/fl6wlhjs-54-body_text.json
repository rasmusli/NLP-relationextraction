Similarities of the time series model across EDs have a number of ramifications for detection of outbreak signatures . First , by borrowing information across the different EDs we can build more complicated multivariate time series models , possibly involving the joint modeling of chest radiograph and visit counts across locations . Second , we could use these models to jointly detect outbreak signatures across large spatial regions . In this context , Diggle et al . [ 20 ] use spatio - temporal Cox models to identify anomalies ( real and artificial outbreaks ) in the space - time distribution of gastrointestinal infections . But , some caution is needed because one potential drawback of aggregating data spatially is that the chance of detection can be reduced ( data from unaffected areas will mask the outbreak signature , and increase the detection time ) [ 21 ] . For localized outbreaks , there is still some utility in building models that borrow strength across EDs , even if the joint detection of outbreak signatures is not meaningful . In terms of these localized outbreaks , a geographically close site could act as a benchmark to judge detections at other sites . For example , under certain circumstances an epidemic detection signal triggered in Columbus , but not in Akron , could imply that some unusual event had occurred in Columbus . It should be noted , however , that even though there are similarities in the time series models , our simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity and timeliness to detect outbreak signatures using chest radiograph counts were different across EDs . These differences may limit the utility of our models in comparing signals across different EDs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 811}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
