We checked the new HMPV genomes for nucleotide differences in the genomic regions targeted by our diagnostic rRT - PCR primers and probes ( Additional file 7 : Table S4 ) used for HMPV detection . Up to eight primer - and probetemplate mismatches were identified ( Fig . 4 ) : one mismatch in the forward primer region in HMPV group A ( F gene - based rRT - PCR assay , Fig . 4a ) ; one mismatch in each of the forward and probe target regions in group B ( F gene - based rRT - PCR assay , Fig . 4b ) ; and 5 different mismatches with the N - gene based rRT - PCR assay ( Fig . 4c ) . Note , the F gene - based rRT - PCR assays are different or specific to the two HMPV groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
