In fact , blow flies have already been recognized as important vectors for mechanical transmission of several serious infectious diseases , that is , poxvirus [ 28 ] , rabbit hemorrhagic disease [ 29 ] , and paratuberculosis [ 30 ] . Recently , it has been reported that the H5N1 viral gene was detected in house flies [ 31 ] and engorged mosquitoes [ 32 ] . We suggest that mechanical transmission by flies may also be involved in the outbreak and pandemic of infectious diseases other than HPAI . However , although there are high densities of a variety of fly species during all seasons in Southeast Asia , their ability to transmit viruses has not been evaluated . The prevalence of H5N1 avian influenza is still a public health problem for birds and humans . Therefore , field and laboratory studies on mechanical transmission of pathogens by flies would be very important for controlling H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks , at least in epidemic Southeast Asian countries . Recently , the H5N1 virus surveillance conducted in Indonesia suggested that pigs are at risk of infection during outbreaks and pigs can serve as intermediate hosts in which this avian virus can adapt to mammals [ 33 ] . They also found the evidence of pig - to - pig transmission of this virus without any significant influenza - like signs . The transmission mechanism of this virus became more complicated and serious . As we introduced in the previous section , blow flies prefer to lick carcasses and droppings of not only chickens but also pigs . Furthermore , we can assume that the flies can access the pigpen easier than the poultry farm . This finding from Indonesia [ 33 ] strongly suggest that it is important to pay attention to pigpens as well as poultry farms within 2 - 3 km , where viable H5N1 viruses are transmitted by blow flies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 92, "end": 97}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 316}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 337}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 373}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 403}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 639, "end": 659}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 670, "end": 675}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 865, "end": 886}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1093}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
