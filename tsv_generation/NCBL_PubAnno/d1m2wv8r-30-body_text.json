The samples were centrifuged at 15 , 000 g for 10 min , and the supernatants were collected . The protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein assay . iTRAQ labelling and peptide fractionation . The iTRAQ labelling was conducted according to the protocol of the iTRAQ reagents ( 8 plex , Applied Biosystems ) . Briefly , the protein samples were thermally denatured , reduced , and alkylated prior to trypsin ( Promega ) digestion for 15 h . The digested samples were labelled with each component of the iTRAQ reagent kit : two mock samples were labelled with 113 and 114 ; and five CPV - infected samples collected at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 hpi were labelled with 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 , and 119 , respectively . Three biological replicates were prepared for all samples . Next , an equal ratio of each set was pooled for analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 717, "end": 721}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
