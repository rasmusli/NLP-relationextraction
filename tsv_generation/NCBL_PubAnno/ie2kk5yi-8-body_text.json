In rodents , Bartonella prevalence varies through time [ 39 , 40 ] , but such patterns have not been well studied in bats [ 41 ] . Individual heterogeneities in infection by age and sex could also inform exposure patterns . Finally , global analyses suggest geographic structure in bat Bartonella genotypes , with notable differences in genotypes from Latin American and those from Africa , Europe , and Asia [ 42 ] . However , as such patterns appear driven by bat families restricted to different continents , analyses within narrower geographic and taxonomic ranges could inform the scale of Bartonella transmission and the role that dispersal plays in the spatial dynamics of this infection [ 43 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
