{"cord_uid": "nfz8w8na", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC7100305", "divid": "49", "text": "This review found that infectious disease outbreaks disproportionately affect the poor , specifically communities with poor physical infrastructure and limited access to quality public health services . The link between income and politics of epidemics has been discussed in the social science literature , where poverty is perceived to be the greatest risk factor . For example , Farmer ( 1996 ) argued that disease outbreaks , e . g . , Ebola systematically affecting poor people and are tied to regional trade networks ( Alsan et al . 2011 ) . Building on this literature , Marcella ( 2011 ) uses the term structural violence to highlight the institutional biases , inequalities , and economic policies that emanate from global centers of power and privilege , which tend to marginalize poor people during outbreaks . These linkages highlight social and economic inequalities ( within communities , societies and countries ) , which are complex and often ignored by the medical ( and political ) communities ( Alsan et al . 2011 ; Leach et al . 2010 ) . Indeed , some of the narratives criticized the ( epidemiological ) evidence , which tends to overlook the role of poverty in the facilitation of disease spread . For instance , focusing on pregnancy in the case of Zika in Brazil was criticized for overlooking the conditions of poverty that might also / instead be responsible for the spike in cases of microcephaly ( Diniz 2016 ) . Furthermore , responding to Ebola in Liberia with developmental aid that is not designed for contexts with insufficient infrastructure was criticized again for overlooking the role of poverty ( Nunes 2016 ) . This limited focus on the role of poverty in the peer - reviewed medical literature calls into question the politics of the research process itself . For example , what institutions are funding the research and what are the interests of the stakeholders in the research process ? Who gets funding to conduct the research ? What are the advantages of overlooking poverty for those producing the evidence ? By disregarding the role of poverty and income inequality , epidemic responses will remain insufficient , and may , instead worsen the situation of poor populations ( Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2005 ) . Perhaps poverty remains unaddressed in epidemic responses as its origins in a neoliberalist society feel too deep to uproot .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 42}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1276}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1410, "end": 1423}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1468, "end": 1474}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
