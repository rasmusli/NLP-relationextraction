{"cord_uid": "u14tj0so", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4064103", "divid": "13", "text": "To summarize , existing methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures suffer from one or both of the following shortcomings : 1 ) slow running time , or 2 ) poor prediction accuracy . Moreover there is limited opportunity for the user to provide structural information , or constraints , that can guide prediction . In cases of a prediction method that incorporates user - defined constraints , it is also useful to understand the degree to which the method ' s accuracy persists as the input information degrades . We use the term robustness with respect to partial information or robustness to refer to this property of a method . ( We note that in our definition of robustness we do not mean robust with respect to noise . ) To the best of our knowledge , the concept of robustness in secondary structure prediction methods has not been studied before .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
