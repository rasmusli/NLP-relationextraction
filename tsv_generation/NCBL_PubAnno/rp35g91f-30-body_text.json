To this end , we interrogated previously published NKX2 - 5 ChIP - seq data derived from two sources . He et al . ( 2011 ) used a doxycycline - inducible dual adenovirus system to express biotinylated NKX2 - 5 in the HL1 cardiomyocyte cell line , while Dupays et al . ( 2015 ) examined endogenous NKX2 - 5 binding in mouse hearts at embryonic day 11 . 5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
