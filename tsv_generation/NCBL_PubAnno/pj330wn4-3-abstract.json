To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin . Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated ciliaFA system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
