In addition to the previously suggested risk factors , occupational exposure and contact with pigs or pork without skin protection , we identified the ingestion of food with a high risk of contamination with S . suis serotype 2 to be an important risk factor for S . suis meningitis . To investigate eating habits as a risk factor of S . suis infection , we focused on potential ' ' high risk ' ' dishes common in Vietnam . These include fresh or under - cooked blood , tonsils , tongue , stomach , intestines and uterus . Such food items typically are undercooked when eaten as a main dish ( as opposed to as components of well cooked main dishes such as rice or noodle soups ) , as was generally the case in our patients . By multivariate analysis , we demonstrated that eating these ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to admission was a significant risk factor for this infection . Eating habits were also confirmed as a risk factor during a relatively small S . suis outbreak in Thailand , associated with consumption of fresh pig blood . [ 12 ] . Eating pork was not associated with S . suis cases in a matched case - control study conducted during the outbreak in Sichuan province in 2005 [ 13 ] . S . suis lives as normal flora in the respiratory , gastrointestinal and genital tract of pigs and can cause invasive disease in 0 . 0 9 9 - - - - ( 1 ) Crude OR based on logistic ( hospital controls ) or conditional logistic regression ( community controls ) .

( 4 ) Only individuals with pigs at home were analyzed . OR could not be analyzed for community controls because none of them reported ill pigs at home . ( 5 ) Only individuals who had pig swab samples at their houses were analyzed . OR could not be analyzed for community controls because there was no discordant pairs included in the analysis . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0017604 . t005 pigs . S . suis was isolated from raw pork samples obtained from markets in Hong Kong [ 14 ] . There may be a high bacterial load in food items that are kept at high ambient temperatures . Therefore , patients may be infected with S . suis through gastrointestinal tract if the ' ' high risk ' ' dishes are served as raw or under - cooked food .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 102}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 396}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 466}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1212, "end": 1221}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
