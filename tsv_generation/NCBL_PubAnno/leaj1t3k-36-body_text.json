This discovery led them to investigate the intrinsic antiviral properties of a range of peptides against HSV - 1 infection in cultured cells . Tested peptides included EB ( stands for entry blocker ; it is a modified FGF4 signal peptide ) , tat , KLA ( a synthetic amphipatic peptide ) , and HOM ( derived from Drosophila antennapedia protein ) , and their modified peptides [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] . In particular , a tat peptide containing a cysteine residue at its C - terminal ( tat - C ) was shown to be able to inhibit infection in three ways : irreversibly inactivating virions exposed to tat - C prior to cell infection , blocking entry of cell - adsorbed viruses , and inducing a state of resistance to infection in cells pretreated with tat - C ( Figure 1 ) [ 109 ] . Mechanisms of antiviral activities have not been determined yet but tat - C seems to act by inhibiting viral entry at the fusion step rather than at the virus attachment step . Virion inactivation may result from tat - C binding to sialic acids on the viral envelop glycoproteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
