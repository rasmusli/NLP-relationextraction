Therefore , an HPLC - UV method was developed and validated for quantification of lycorine in various H . littoralis extracts . Lycorine absorbed maximum UV wavelength at 325 nm , which was selected as detection wavelength . The wavelength selected differs from previous reports which ranged between 287 and 292 nm [ 2 , 7 , 14 ] . Lycorine was eluted in the present HPLC method within 5 min and the total run time was 10 min .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
