In order to understand whether ODN 2216 exert similar effects in the cat , treated cultures of feline PBMCs , FEA , CrFK and fcwf - 4 cells were systematically screened for increased mRNA expression of IFN\u03b1 and IL - 6 following stimulation . Although all tested immortalized feline cell lines expressed TLR9 mRNA ( data not shown ) , they failed to respond to stimulation with ODN 2216 ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown ) . However , this molecule exhibited potent immunomodulatory properties in feline PBMCs : when measured 24 h post stimulation , a concentration of only 1 \u03bcg / mL ODN 2216 was sufficient to enhance transcription of IFN\u03b1 by 40 - fold , and a maximum induction of this gene was observed when 4 \u03bcg / mL ODN were used ( Figure 3C ) . Although affected in a similar pattern , the mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL - 6 remained comparatively low at all concentrations tested ( Figure 3D ) . In experiments foreseen to determine gene expression kinetics in feline cells after stimulation with the ODN 2216 molecule , an influence on IFN\u03b1 transcription could be measured as early as 3 h after treatment of PBMCs , whereas increased levels of IL - 6 mRNA were observed only as of 6 h post stimulation ( Figure 3E and F ) . Notably , the highest induction of both genes was measured 24 h after addition of ODN 2216 to the cultures , with transcription increasing by 9000 - fold and 39fold at this time point for IFN\u03b1 and IL - 6 respectively ( Figure 3E and F ) . The observed effects were specifically conferred by the CpG motifs comprised in the 2216 ODN , since specific control ODN 2243 only induced slight elevations in the expression of the genes tested ( Figure 3C - F ) . Importantly , trypan blue exclusion experiments indicated no evidence of cellular toxicity after treatment neither with ODN 2216 nor with ODN 2243 at all concentrations tested ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
