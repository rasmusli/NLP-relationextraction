Twenty - four hours after lentivirus - mediated shRNAs transduction , PK - 15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0 . 1 . The viral replication was analyzed by real - time RT - PCR , virus titration and Western blotting . In comparison with the shNC control , the viral genome copies in the eEF1A - knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A ) . Similarly , the CSFV titers were significantly increased after eEF1A knockdown in PK - 15 cells ( Figure 4B ) , and the N pro protein expression in the sheEF1A - transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C ) . The results indicate that the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
