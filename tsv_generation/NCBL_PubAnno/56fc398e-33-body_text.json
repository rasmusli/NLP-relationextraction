When epidemics are seeded in Cumbria , almost all infected movements occur within Cumbria itself and to neighbouring counties ( figure 3 ) . An average of 8 . 9 farms become infected in Cumbria after 12 weeks , with 13 . 9 in North Yorkshire and 4 . 2 , 4 . 0 , 4 . 0 and 8 . 0 in Durham , Lancashire , Dumfries and Galloway , and Aberdeen , respectively . All other counties have epidemic sizes of fewer than two farms when the epidemic is seeded in Cumbria .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
