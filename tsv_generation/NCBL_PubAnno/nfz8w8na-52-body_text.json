The review highlighted the role of politics and power in shaping different narratives , whereby powerful institutions assert particular narratives ( often marginalizing the populations ) , which are Bpushedt o frame policies , publications , interventions , and funding agendas , while the narratives of the marginalized populations ( those voiced by or representing marginalized people ) are marginalized ( Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2005 ) . This type of outbreak narrative was evident in the three epidemics discussed in this paper . In Toronto , SARS became a racialized disease , ultimately victimizing and excluding the Asian - Canadian community ( Jacobs 2007 ; Ali 2008 ) . The spread of the Zika virus in Brazil is largely attributed to the consequences of globalization , including the widening habitat of the Aedes mosquito vector and increased human and air travel ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 ; Gyawali et al . 2016 ; Fast et al . 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017e ; Ordaz - N\u00e9meth et al . 2017 ) . Cultural explanations are prominent in the outbreak narrative speaking to Ebola in Liberia , specifically the human consumption of bush meat and local / traditional burial practices that involve the touching and kissing of the deceased ( Hagan et al . 2015 ; Kobayashi et al . 2015 ; Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c ; Washington and Meltzer 2015 ; Ng 2008 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 808}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 964}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
