We therefore consider how network properties change as fewer data are used by the various sampling schemes . We first consider the number of strongly connected components of the network . A subset of nodes forms a strongly connected component if each of the nodes can connect to each other node by following a path which preserves edge direction . If the largest of these components is of the same order as the complete network it is known as the giant strongly connected component ( GSCC ) and gives a lower bound to the maximum size of an outbreak on the network if the disease is perfectly transmissible [ 33 ] . In addition , we explore the impact of the sampling schemes upon the mean and standard deviation of the weighted w and unweighted k degree of nodes in the GSCC . Finally , we investigate the tendency for similar nodes to connect to each other through degree assortativity [ 40 , 41 ] . These statistics are averaged over 1000 realizations of the network for each sampling method . The diameter of the GSCC was also measured but , owing to extensive computational time , this was only calculated for a single realization of the network . The diameter of a network is the length of the longest shortest path across the network [ 40 ] . As well as the network statistics mentioned previously , we also explore the number of nodes and edges captured by the various sampling schemes as the percentage of sampled data varies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
