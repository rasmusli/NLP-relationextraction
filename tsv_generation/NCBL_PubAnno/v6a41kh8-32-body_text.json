In tropical Asian countries , somewhat contradictory patterns of associations between RSV and meteorological factors have been observed . In Hong Kong , the monthly incidence of RSV infection was positively correlated with both temperature and relative humidity [ 48 ] , whereas in Malaysia , the number of RSV infections was inversely correlated with temperature [ 52 ] . RSV infections peaked towards the end of the rainy season during the first and third year of our study . We explored whether there could be an association between preceding rainfall and RSV infections , and by introducing a 2 - month lag after peak precipitation , such an association could indeed be identified ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 29}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 159}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 328}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 430}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 549}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 626}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 812}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
