The concentration of Env - specific IgG present in such secretions varies considerably from person to person and is usually on the order of 100 to 1 , 000 - fold less than concentrations found in plasma [ 18 ] . The presence of Env - specific IgG strongly suggests that some proportion of Env molecules on the surface of infectious virions in genital tract secretions is coated with IgG . Since HIV - 1 is successfully transmitted sexually , the coating antibody is either of insufficient quantity or quality to neutralize virus infectivity upon contact with an uninfected partner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 152}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
