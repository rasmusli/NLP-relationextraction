Both pathogens are known to cause pneumonia on their own and both are not commonly carried by healthy young persons [ 5 , 13 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . These facts support the argument that they were copathogens with pneumococcus which was found in pleural fluid , tracheal aspirates , and blood . In conclusion , the simultaneous isolations of 3 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens have not been reported in our locality and may contribute to the fatal outcome of this unfortunate child .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 220}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
