{"cord_uid": "u14tj0so", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4064103", "divid": "60", "text": "As shown in Figure 2A , Iterative HFold ' s average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from about 54 % to 79 % as the user provides 1 % to 40 % of the input structure . This improvement in accuracy slows down but still persists when further structural information is provided . If we compare the slope of the curve for Iterative HFold ' s average accuracy to that of HFold in Figure 2A , we can see that HFold ' s slope is steeper than that of Iterative HFold , making Iterative HFold more robust than HFold . For pseudoknot - free structures of the HK - PK - free data set , as shown in Figure 2B , HFold performs better than Iterative HFold . Even with 1 % information about G big , HFold results in ( 79 . 76 % , 84 . 32 % ) 95 % bootstrap confidence interval in comparison with ( 79 . 14 % , 83 . 84 % ) for Iterative HFold with the same inputs . Roughly , HFold ' s success for pseudoknot - free structures is because it often http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 adds base pairs that do not cross those provided as part of the input , and thus are likely to be in G big .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
