The clonogenic survival assays were conducted as previously described 41 . Mouse care and treatment was approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Cells maintained under standard conditions were detached by treatment with 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA solution and washed in Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) . They were then suspended in a 60 % mixture of Matrigel Matrix ( BD Biosciences ) in HBSS at a concentration of 1 . 0 \u00d7 10 6 cells per 100 \u03bcL of solution . The cells were then injected into the subcutis overlying the rear flanks of 6 - week - old male nude mice ( Harlan ) . Once the tumors were established , the animals were randomized into three treatment groups per xenograft . The both cyc - LHSPW and cyc - NGR were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile PBS to a final DMSO concentration of 5 % v / v . The mice were then dosed via tail vein injection with 40 mg / kg of the cyclic peptides or saline at days three times a week for four weeks total . Tumor measurements were made twice weekly with calipers and the tumor volume ( in mm 3 ) was calculated by the formula 0 . 5236 \u00d7 length ( L ) \u00d7 width ( W ) \u00d7 height ( H ) . The endpoint of the study was either five weeks after the first treatment dose or when the tumors reached a volume of 1 , 000 mm 3 as dictated by our animal protocol . PC3 tumors were removed from euthanized animals , formalin fixed and stained for Ki67 using the manufacturer ' s protocol .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 739}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1373, "end": 1380}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1450, "end": 1461}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
