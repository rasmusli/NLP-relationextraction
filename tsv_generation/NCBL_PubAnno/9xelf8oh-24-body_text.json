( 2010 ) SYBR \u00ae green assay , showing good qualitative agreement ; k value ( agreement ) of 0 . 75 ( n = 7 ) and 1 . 00 ( n = 12 ) for grey and red squirrel assays , respectively . In comparing the quantitative values ( i . e . C p values ) of the developed SQPV assays and the Atkin et al . ( 2010 ) assay , strong correlation was witnessed ( r = 1 . 00 and 0 . 99 for grey and red squirrel assays , respectively ) . By contrast , we found only moderate agreement between qualitative results of SADV detected in tissues by TEM and our assay results ( k value = 0 . 39 , n = 15 ; red squirrel SADV assay ) . In fact , none of the grey squirrel tissues tested ( n = 5 ) showed evidence of SADV viral particles by TEM , which was not surprising due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection in the grey squirrel . By contrast , the k value between the developed red and grey squirrel SADV assays was 1 and it showed a strong correlation between quantitative results ( r = 1 . 00 , n = 15 ) . Our uniplex and multiplex assays gave the same information about whether samples were positive or negative ( k value = 1 . 00 ( n = 8 per assay ) ) and displayed high correlations in the absolute quantification ( i . e . C p values ) of viral load ( r = 0 . 82 , 0 . 98 and 0 . 85 for grey squirrel assays and r = 0 . 98 , 0 . 98 and 1 . 00 for red squirrel assays , with correlations displayed for tests of PGK , SQPV and ADV , respectively ) . When viral loads were calculated as RQ values , the correlation coefficients for comparison of uniplex and multiplex assays were r = 1 . 00 and 1 . 00 ( n = 8 ) for grey squirrel SQPV and SADV assays and r = 0 . 85 and 1 . 00 ( n = 8 ) for red squirrel SQPV and SADV assays , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
