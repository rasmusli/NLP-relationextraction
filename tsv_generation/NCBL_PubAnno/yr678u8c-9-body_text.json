Initial work showed that MHV infection induced autophagy [ 50 ] . Nsp8 co - localised with LC3 throughout infection and the nucleocapsid protein N co - localised with LC3 early in infection , but this decreased over time . In addition , MHV replication was markedly reduced in ATG5 \u2212 / \u2212 embryonic stem cell lines but virus titre was rescued in the presence of an ATG5 expressing plasmid [ 50 ] . Further work using SARS - CoV again showed co - localisation between nsp8 and LC3 [ 51 ] . However , work by others using bone marrow derived macrophages lacking ATG5 or ATG5 \u2212 / \u2212 primary murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , showed that MHV replication does not require either an intact autophagy pathway or conversion of LC3I to LC3II . They did however confirm that SARS - CoV nsps co - localised with LC3 [ 52 ] . Recently , Schneider et al . demonstrated that SARS - CoV replication could also occur in ATG5 \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs , indicating no requirement for a complete autophagy pathway [ 53 ] . Interestingly , it was observed that virus replication was unaffected by the induction of autophagy in wild type MEFs [ 53 ] . Finally , de Haan et al . were unable to show co - localisation between MHV nsp8 and GFP - LC3 [ 54 ] , and Snijder et al . were unable to show co - localisation between SARS - CoV nsp3 and either endogenous LC3 or GFP - LC3A , GFP - LC3B or GFP - LC3C [ 9 ] . Despite the lack of clarity with regard to the requirement for autophagy during coronavirus infection , all studies did indicate that LC3 became punctate upon coronavirus infection , suggesting an induction of autophagy [ 9 , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1691, "end": 1703}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
