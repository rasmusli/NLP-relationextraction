On the server side , the Sapling Server accesses a database implemented by an entity - relationship data model ( ERDB ) . The ERDB model is defined by a set of XML metadata describing the entities , relationships , and attributes in a form that can be used to generate queries as well as the documentation and an up - to - date database diagram may be viewed at http : / / servers . nmpdr . org / figdisk / FIG / ErdbDocWidget . cgi ? database = Sapling . Thus , the public description of the database always remains synchronized with the internal data structures - an important benefit in a database designed for public use .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
