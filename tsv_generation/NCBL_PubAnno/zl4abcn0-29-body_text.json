The investigation shows that lycorine production in initiated callus at 4 . 5 M 2 , 4 - D alone and 9 . 00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4 . 5 M BAP is not significantly different while there is significant difference when compared with wild plant extract ( > 0 . 05 ) . This indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant . Thus , for the upcoming study , this hormone combination could be a good start to initiate a callus from H . littoralis to obtain secondary metabolites . Hence , the present analytical method may be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the callus culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H . littoralis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
