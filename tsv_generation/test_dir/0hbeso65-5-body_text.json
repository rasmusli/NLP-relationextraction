As mentioned above , reinfection of the liver graft is universal and characterized by accelerated progression of liver disease . Furthermore , treatment of recurrent HCV infection after LT is compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon - based therapies . In addition , poor outcome after graft reinfection of HCV has increasingly become a major problem faced by the hepatologists and transplant surgeons . Thus , novel preventive and therapeutic strategies of HCV reinfection are urgently needed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
