Imidazole - based compounds mimicking an alpha helix in the LEL of CD81 compete for HCV E2 - CD81 binding [ 111 ] . These drugs bind E2 in a reversible manner and block E2 - CD81 interaction while having no effect neither on CD81 expression nor on CD81 interaction with physiological partner molecules . In addition , recent study demonstrated that anti - CD81 antibodies completely protected human liver - uPA - SCID mice from a subsequent challenge with HCV consensus strains of different genotypes [ 112 ] . However , administration of anti - CD81 antibodies after viral challenge had no effect . Anti - SR - BI antibodies , which block the interaction of SR - BI with HCV , are another interesting strategy to prevent HCV entry . Anti - SR - BI antibodies have been demonstrated to inhibit HCVcc infection in vitro [ 113 ] . Moreover , small molecule inhibitors of SR - BI have recently been developed . For example , ITX5061 is a compound that inhibits entry of HCVpp from all major genotypes and HCVcc infection without affecting viral replication [ 114 ] . In addition , recent study demonstrated that a human monoclonal antibody targeting SR - BI efficiently precluded HCV infection and viral spread after LT in vitro and in vivo [ 115 ] . Kinetic studies suggest that this small molecule inhibitor targets HCV entry during an early postbinding stage . CLDN1 has been suggested to play an important role in cell - cell transmission . Recently , anti - CLDN1 antibodies inhibiting HCV infection in vitro have been developed [ 116 ] . The results have shown that anti - CLDN1 antibodies efficiently block cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that are resistant to host neutralizing antibodies . As mentioned above , EGFR and EphA2 are two newly established host factors for HCV entry . Thus , their respective inhibitors , erlotinib and dasatinib , are also regarded as promising HCV inhibitors in preventing HCV reinfection after LT [ 103 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 51}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 51}, "obj": "ne"}]}
