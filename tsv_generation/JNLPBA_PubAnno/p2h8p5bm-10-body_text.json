Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that POWV infects macrophages and fibroblasts in the skin , shortly after the tick bite , also , other unidentified cells were shown to be infected [ 51 ] . Interestingly , macrophages were found to be the primary target for POWV in the spleen [ 52 ] , and in the CNS , which is the main target site for POWV infection , neurons have been shown to be the primary target for POWV in mice and humans [ 52 , 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
