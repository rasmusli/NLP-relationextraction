In other words , the IO data sources were lacking in other provincial capital cities and medium - sized cities in China . Consequently , the IDA methods were used more frequently than the SDA methods based on IO technique [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] , owing to its applicability in which each model can be applied to any available data at any aggregation level in a period - wise or timeseries manner [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] , where the preferred one in the LMDI [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] . By means of LMDI method , Wang et al . [ 46 ] investigated the main driver for industrial carbon emissions in Beijing - Tianjin - Hebei economic band from 1996 to 2010 , and the results showed that economic output and energy intensity were both the most important influencing factors . Wang et al . [ 42 ] decomposed the influencing factors of residential carbon emissions in Beijing and found that the rising per capita GDP and the declining energy intensity contributed the most to emissions changes during 2000 to 2010 . Similar results , conducted by Wang et al . [ 54 ] , can also be found in Suzhou city . Zhao et al . [ 49 ] decomposed the main drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai and found that industrial output , energy intensity , energy and industrial structure were major determinants for emissions changes . Shao et al . [ 50 ] adopted an extended LMDI method and investigated the techno - economic drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai , and the results showed that industrial output scale was mainly responsible for emission increments while industrial structure adjustment , R & D intensity , and energy intensity were most significant factors in mitigating emissions . Kang et al . [ 51 ] performed a multi - sectoral decomposition analysis of city - level greenhouse gas emissions in Tianjin from 2001 to 2009 , including the agricultural , industrial , transportation , commercial and other sectors , and the results showed that economic growth was the most important driver for emissions increments while energy efficiency was primarily responsible for emissions reductions . Hopefully , previous studies about driving factors and influencing mechanisms of city - level carbon emissions performed on China ' s megacities such as Beijing , Shanghai etc . , have made great contributions to the realization of regional low - carbon road map . But , the previous LMDI studies mainly focused on the economic growth effect , the energy intensity effect , the population size effect , and the technology progress effect influencing the change of carbon emissions . It fails to distinguish the effects of economic structure , population structure , and energy structure on the change of carbon emissions . In fact , the strongest factors that offset China ' s energy consumption and carbon emissions have shifted from efficiency gains to structural changes [ 74 , 75 ] . Structural indicators combined with other traditional and emerging factors should also be deeply considered and investigated in China ' s regional energy and carbon researches , which may perform different influencing mechanism in different regions during different development stages . Compared with four municipalities , there were relatively few studies conducting on Guangzhou city , one of China ' s first - tier cities , with the considerable GDP scale and total energy consumption amount ( Table 2 ) . Meanwhile , Guangzhou has the highest level of per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption than the four municipalities . Guangzhou is the provincial capital of Guangdong province , the most developed coastal region in the southeast of China ( Fig 1 ) . In addition , Guangzhou city is an important manufacturing base in China as well as a pilot zone for low - carbon city announced by China ' s National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) in 2012 . Therefore , Guangzhou city may serve as a demonstration of how to realize the targets of low - carbon city development , thereby highlighting the importance and representativeness of studying its features and drivers for carbon emissions in detail .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
