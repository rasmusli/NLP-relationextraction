These children were , after obtaining informed parental consent , included in a study on zinc as adjuvant therapy for CAP ( to be presented elsewhere ) . All included children were randomized to receive either 10 to 20 mg elemental zinc dispersed in water or placebo tablets daily for 14 days . Cases with very severe pneumonia / disease , that is , cough or difficult breathing with stridor when calm or any general danger signs ( inability to drink / breastfeed , persistent vomiting , convulsions , lethargy , or unconsciousness ) were not included in the study , but instead referred to a tertiary level hospital after initial treatment . Other exclusion criteria are listed in the study profile ( Figure 1 ) . Children could not participate in the study again until after 6 months due to the 6 - month follow - up scheme of the clinical trial .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
