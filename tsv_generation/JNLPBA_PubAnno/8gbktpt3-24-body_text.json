The remaining crypts were often ectatic , with variable numbers of crypt abscesses ( Figure 4 ) . Evidence of multifocal crypt regeneration was also variably present . The submucosa and tunica muscularis were variably expanded by congestion , fibrin , oedema , haemorrhage , perivascular lymphocytes and plasma cells , macrophages exhibiting erythrophagocytosis , occasional neutrophils and rare eosinophils . In sections of mesenteric lymph nodes , the most common finding was multifocal follicular and paracortical lymphoid depletion with accentuation of the reticuloendothelial architecture ( Figure 4 ) . Depleted lymphoid follicles were small , poorly populated and contained central accumulations of hyalinized eosinophilic material ( follicular hyalinosis ) with variable numbers of tangible body macrophages . The subcapsular and medullary sinuses were expanded by erythrocytes , oedema fluid and moderate to markedly increased numbers of macrophages , some exhibiting erythrophagocytosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
