Studies that examine the joint effects of viral coinfection , bacterial carriage and bacterial pneumonia would provide one strategy for filling this gap . However , we found only two such studies . In a South African hospital - based surveillance study of severe acute respiratory illness , 969 nasopharyngeal - oropharyngeal specimens were tested for S . pneumoniae and a panel of respiratory viruses . A high pneumococcal colonization density in the nasopharynx and oropharynx was associated with both respiratory virus co - infection and pneumococcal pneumonia [ 86 ] . A second hospital - based casecontrol study compared nasopharyngeal carriage among 274 radiologically confirmed cases of pneumonia , 276 cases of other LRT infections and 350 controls in Vietnam . Their findings for S . pneumoniae were similar to that of the South African study . However , the investigators also studied H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis and found no clear association between viral co - infection , nasopharyngeal bacterial load and pneumonia for these species [ 87 ] . As noted above , M . catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia , but H . influenzae is second only to S . pneumoniae . Although there appears to be a persuasive argument for a link between viral co - infection , carriage and pneumonia for S . pneumoniae , whether or why the interaction is not true for other URT bacteria needs further exploration . In particular , studies that can directly test whether viral infection led to bacterial colonization or overgrowth by a potential pathogen , which led to bacterial pneumonia by that pathogen , are in order . In conclusion , there is no definitive answer to our first hypothesis . Epidemiologic studies and experiments indicate viruses alter the bacterial community in the URT , but they do not yet adequately address whether these changes in the URT bacterial community play a significant role in pneumonia etiology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
