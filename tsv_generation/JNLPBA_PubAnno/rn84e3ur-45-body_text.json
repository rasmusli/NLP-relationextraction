So the frequent walking of the crew members or the passengers will raise the infection risk level in the airplane cabin . However , a 1 . 7 % ~ 2 . 2 % increase is not so significant . By estimating the likelihoods of a series of human movement assumptions , the no movement case has the highest likelihood and is most likely to be the real case . This conclusion fits with the estimated results given by a previous study which stated that no human movement is the most probable case [ 18 ] . This result does not imply that there is no human movement in the real outbreak case , which is impossible . The crew members or the passengers may still walk frequently in the airplane when the index patient is not coughing . It needs to be emphasized that although the no movement case is the most likely case in this outbreak case , the conclusion may not be generalized to all outbreak cases because the numerical simulation and the risk assessment are casedependent .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
