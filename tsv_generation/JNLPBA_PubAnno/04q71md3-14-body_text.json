Commonlyused Bayesian measures of model fit ( such as marginal likelihood estimation using the harmonic mean ) , which can be applied to models with among - location movement rates fixed to a particular predictor , have been shown to perform poorly [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] . Although more accurate alternatives have recently been proposed [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] , they are computationally prohibitive on large data sets such as those studied here . Importantly , the previous approach provides only a relative ranking of different models and , unlike the GLM model , cannot identify which of the top - ranked predictors need to be jointly considered as explanatory variables . A further advantage of the GLM approach is that in addition to providing a measure of support for each predictor , it can also quantify the contribution or effect size of each predictor by estimating the associated coefficients ( b ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
