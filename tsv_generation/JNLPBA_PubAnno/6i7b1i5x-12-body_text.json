These were seemingly specific and prominent in seven KD biopsy specimens , however the fourteen control specimens were from autopsies that succumbed generally from non - inflammatory and non - cardiac syndromes . Notably , mature memory and immature B cells ( CD20 + cells ) were lacking [ 83 ] . Due to the late time point of these specimens , this may not be inconsistent with other reports reviewed previously . The lack of CD20 + B cells was theorized to be from early coronary infiltration of CD20 + B cells followed by immediate switching of these B cells to plasma cells [ 84 ] . This increase in infiltrative IgA + plasma cells could not be explained by a generalized increase in peripheral IgA + cell , as none was shown in acute or convalescent KD [ 3 ] . The largest study , relying on electron microscopic studies , suggests that there is an early necrotizing arteritis indicative of an acute viral infection , followed by a vasculitis , then luminal myofibroblast proliferation [ 77 ] . Although this study had 32 samples , it only had three within two weeks of disease onset and a number of findings were different than previous studies . Collection and study of these types of rare samples should continue .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
