The RH and temperature inside the irradiation chamber were monitored using an Omega RH32 meter ( Omega Engineering Inc . , Stamford , CT ) immediately following the baffles . A Hal Technologies HAL - HPC300 particle sizer ( Fontana , CA ) was adjoined to the irradiation chamber to allow for sampling of particle sizes throughout operation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
