Importantly , the rabies outbreak samples collected by the CDPH were accompanied by epidemiologically important documentation such as exact date and location for most of the samples . Additionally the CDPH ' s ongoing surveillance efforts provided a unique repository of samples for previous rabies host jumping events , which failed to be efficiently transmitted within the gray fox population . Next generation sequencing technology has recently been used to examine viral heterogeneity of rabies genomes present in infected tissues but has not yet been optimized for detection of rare genotypes ( less than 1 % ) [ 26 ] . Deep genome sequencing of these recent and past samples allowed us to define the viral mutational dynamics that were associated with a skunk rabies virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes , suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species . Historically , the skunk rabies virus variant present in Humboldt Co . has been detected in foxes more frequently than in any other region of the state but not until 2009 has transmission shifted so disproportionally to the fox population [ 11 ] . Our data indicate that the outbreak haplotype responsible is able to be transmitted readily by both skunks and foxes since no genetic changes viral sequence differentiated the skunks and the foxes from the epizootic . These results are similar to those from a study describing the genetic changes associated with the Arizona CST events in that the rabies genotype from the donor species ( bats ) could not be differentiated from that found in the recipient species ( skunks or foxes ) [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 557}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
