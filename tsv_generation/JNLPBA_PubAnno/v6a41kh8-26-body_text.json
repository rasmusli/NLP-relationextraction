Etiology studies in developing countries that included viruses have identified RSV in a median of 20 % ( 5th to 95th percentile 1 to 53 ) of LRTI cases [ 30 ] and in 6 % to 96 % ( mean 39 % ) of LRTI cases with a viral etiology [ 1 ] . It should be noted that many of these studies also included measles . A recently published denominator - based study from a birth cohort comprising 635 Kenyan children followed through three RSV epidemics reported that 13 % of cases with LRTI were attributable to RSV infection , which was diagnosed using IF [ 31 ] . In India , RSV accounted for 17 % of hospitalized cases with LRTI in New Delhi [ 32 ] and 7 % of LRTI cases included in a 3 - year longitudinal community study in Haryana [ 28 ] . After RSV , InfA and PIV3 were the most common viruses in our study , as reported elsewhere [ 1 , 3 , 28 ] . We detected hMPV in 4 . 2 % of pneumonia cases . It is estimated that MPV worldwide accounts for 5 to 7 % of ARI in young children requiring hospitalization [ 33 ] . In India , hMPV was detected in 3 . 2 % of 662 children hospitalized for ARI over a 2 - year period from April 2005 [ 34 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
