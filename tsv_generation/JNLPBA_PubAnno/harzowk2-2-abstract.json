Serotype 19A is not covered by the 7 - or 10 - valent pneumococcal vaccines . Mycoplasma pneumoniae and metapneumovirus were simultaneously detected by PCR in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates . The pneumococcus is penicillin sensitive . Although infections with each of these pathogens alone are typically mild , this case highlights that co - infection with the triple respiratory pathogens possibly contributed to the fatal outcome of this child . Also , the new policy in Hong Kong to use PCV13 may help prevent further cases of serotype 19A infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
