Unfortunately , most pyrethroids , like permethrin and deltamethrin , cannot be used in cats due to their toxicity to this species . The recent launch of a collar containing an additional compound belonging to this chemical class , flumethrin , that is well tolerated in the cat might represent a valid preventive option for the individual reduction of risk for infection of cats in highly endemic areas of leishmaniosis , and for limiting the infectiousness of those that are already infected . In fact , this collar was found useful in reduction of the incidence of L . infantum infection in dogs [ 90 , 91 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
