We sampled sites one to two times annually , capturing one to 17 individuals per site and sampling interval ( S1 Table ) . To screen for Bartonella by PCR , up to 30 \u03bcL blood was stored on Whatman FTA cards at room temperature . To assess the presence of Bartonella in saliva and feces , we collected oral and rectal swabs from vampire bats in Peru . Swabs were preserved in 2 mL RNAlater ( Invitrogen ) at - 80 [UNK] C until laboratory analyses . For Peru sites sampled in 2016 , we also recorded the number of bat flies per vampire bat [ 32 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
