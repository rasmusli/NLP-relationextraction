By using likelihood analysis , the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rate , b 1 and b 2 can be obtained ( data not shown ) . The maximum likelihood is 0 . 763 , when the quanta generation rate is 1 . 36 million , b 1 is 0 . 014 and b 2 is zero . This likelihood value is much higher than that of the previous cases . So , the risk assessment results will better fit the real case when the movement of the seated passengers is considered . An average walking possibility of 1 . 4 % can be used to represent and simulate the movement behaviors of all the seated passengers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
