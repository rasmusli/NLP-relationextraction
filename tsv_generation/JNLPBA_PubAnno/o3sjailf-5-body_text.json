[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Its prevalence in stools ranges from 0 . 2 % to 1 . 6 % in diarrheic and non - diarrheic subjects worldwide . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Furthermore , astrovirus VA1 has been identified in brain biopsies of immunocompromised patients with central nervous system disease , 9 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] but it has never been documented in respiratory specimens until now . Current molecular diagnostic assays used in most routine laboratories target only the classical HAstV 1 - 8 serotypes , which belong to the Mamastrovirus 1 species ; yet , astrovirus VA1 cannot be diagnosed because it shares only a 46 % nucleotide sequence identity with the full genome of HAstV - 1 . This is particularly unfortunate , as a recent investigation of healthy adult blood donors in the United States showed that 65 % of the samples were seropositive . 14 In terms of public health relevance , there is increasing evidence that astrovirus VA1 and other novel HAstVs recently described worldwide ( i . e . , astrovirus VA1 - 5 and MLB1 - 3 15 ) may be of importance in routine diagnostics , particularly in immunocompromised patients . To our knowledge , our finding is the first documented case of an astrovirus VA1 in the respiratory tract , and it justifies considering the potential association of recently identified new human astroviruses , such as astrovirus VA1 , with", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
