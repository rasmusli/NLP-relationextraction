These figures would , by extrapolation , correspond to a total number of 559 children with influenza - associated PICU admission in Germany within the 3 - year post - pandemic period , with an annual average of 186 children . This is almost 28 times as high as the annual average of six to seven influenza - associated PICU admissions detected by nation - wide PICU surveillance in Germany during three pre - pandemic years without active screening [ 18 ] . Furthermore , the incidence estimates for the subtype A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 derived from our active screening study were higher in the first and third post - pandemic seasons ( 1 . 35 and 1 . 17 , respectively ) than previous incidence estimates for PICU patients in the pandemic ( 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 ) and the first post - pandemic ( approximately 0 . 4 ) season in Germany [ 19 , 20 ] . Thus , our results indicate possible underreporting in previous studies , and show a continued high level of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 - associated PICU admissions even 3 years after the pandemic . In our study , the proportions of children with bacteriaassociated complications ( secondary bacterial pneumonia , sepsis ) were similar to the proportions observed during the pre - pandemic period , but appeared higher than those observed during the pandemic 2009 / 10 [ 19 ] . The lower proportions observed during the pandemic might be explained by the time shift of the peak of influenza cases , which was observed as early as November 2009 in Germany [ 19 ] . Thus , the pandemic influenza peak did not coincide with the seasonal peak of Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterial pathogen most frequently associated with community - acquired influenza [ 23 ] . Antiviral treatment patterns changed considerably during the post - pandemic period , with a decrease in the proportion of paediatric influenza cases receiving oseltamivir from previously 50 % [ 18 ] and 61 % [ 19 ] to 19 % . Oseltamivir is considered to be most advantageous when administered within the first 48 h of influenza disease . The reduced use in the post - pandemic period may therefore be partly due to the fact that median time between onset of influenza symptoms and PICU admission was longer than during the pandemic ( 3 vs . 2 days [ 19 ] ) . Increasing uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the treatment of paediatric influenza may also have played a role [ 24 , 25 ] . Post - pandemic oseltamivir treatment was associated with co - infections and longer PICU stay , suggesting that it were mainly children with severe complications or with serious underlying conditions who received this medication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 916, "end": 941}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
