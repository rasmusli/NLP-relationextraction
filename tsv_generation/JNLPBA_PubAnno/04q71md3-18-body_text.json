To compare the spread of influenza under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic spread , we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak times ( across 100 simulations ) and the observed peak times for all locations except Mexico ( based on World Health Organization data ; Text S1 ) . Correspondence was measured using the Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient , and tested with associated p - values obtained using a permutation test ( Text S1 ) , as well as using the mean average error ( MAE ; in days ) . We consider the Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they are more robust to outliers , which are clearly present in the observed peaks . Therefore , the scaling of between - population coupling c for the various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize Spearman ' s rank correlation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1078, "end": 1087}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
