Although both diets share similar indications , there are nutritional differences between the two diets that are worth considering . The macronutrient distribution of protein , fat , and carbohydrate differed between the two formulas . The percent of calories from protein , fat , and carbohydrate were 31 , 31 , and 38 % in Diet A and 35 , 40 , and 25 % in Diet B , respectively ( Table 1 ) . While protein level was similar between the two formulas , the fat and carbohydrate contents varied more widely . Reduced dietary fat has been recommended in patients with gastroenteropathy due to potentially impaired fat absorption ( 7 , 8 ) ; however , dietary fat was shown to have no difference in clinical response in cats with chronic diarrhea ( 6 ) . The presence of concurrent chronic pancreatitis has also been an indication for feeding reduced or moderate fat diets in cats with gastroenteropathies ( 17 ) ; however , cats with increased fPL levels were excluded from this study . Carbohydrate malabsorption was previously reported in cats with IBD , but dietary carbohydrates were not shown to negatively impact clinical signs ( 18 ) . The higher dietary carbohydrate content of Diet A , relative to Diet B , did not appear to negatively impact diet performance and was well tolerated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1100, "end": 1104}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
