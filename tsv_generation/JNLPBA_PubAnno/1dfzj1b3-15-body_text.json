Another example of indirect method is based on the reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + , in the presence of 2 , 4 , 6 - trypyridyl - s - triazine . This method is known as FRAP ( ferric reducing antioxidant power ) . There are also methods based on the chemiluminescence of luminal in the presence of free radicals , which can be produced through AAPH [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
