However , no such study has been conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in host response to CPV infection . Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) is an in vitro labelling method that has the capability to compare several time points during a single experiment 18 . The method is considered more sensitive than difference gel electrophoresis , and it has been demonstrated to be effective and accurate in characterising numerous diseases 19 , 20 . In this study , we utilised an iTRAQ - labelled mass spectrometry approach to explore the proteomic changes of F81 cells under different cellular growth behaviour induced by CPV infection . Our findings will help to reveal the biological processes of different infection stages and systematically understand the host response under CPV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 663, "end": 669}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
