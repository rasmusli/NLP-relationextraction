Several other studies have reported similar results where no serological evidence of MERS - CoV infection was detected in domestic animalexposed populations , including abattoir workers in sites where infected camels have been documented . 10 , 11 During October 2012 , researchers in KSA collected and tested serum samples from 226 abattoir workers in Jeddah and Makkah . Using an immunofluorescence assay , none had evidence of elevated MERS - CoV antibody . 11 Similarly , in another 2013 study where nasal swabs from Egyptian camels suggested MERS - CoV was present , there was no evidence of seropositivity among the camel workers with intense contact to these same camels . 10 species are serving as additional reservoirs for this pathogen or serving as vectors in transferring infection from camels to humans . Alternatively , perhaps our assay lacks sensitivity , or MERS - CoV infection may produce a weak or transient immune response following mild or asymptomatic infection . Finally , it is possible that only a subset of the human population has the predilection to be infected by MERS - CoV , either because of genetic polymorphisms or unusual routes of exposure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 845, "end": 850}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
