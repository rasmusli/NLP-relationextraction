Phylogenetic analysis revealed the closest related virus was taken from a domestic cat in Japan in 1994 ( GenBank accession no . AB000050 ) , although it is likely that a closer ancestral virus exists but has not been sampled here . The 100 % sequence identity of VP2 sequences from cases in Mildura and Melbourne is consistent with the epidemiological investigation , which found evidence supporting direct viral spread through transport of unvaccinated cats for adoption in 2014 and 2015 . The nonenveloped virions of FPV , shed in high titres in all excretions of infected animals , are environmentally resilient and remain viable in infected premises such as shelters for over a year [ 17 , 18 ] . Indirect transmission by fomites is a major mechanism of parvovirus transmission among cats and dogs and was likely a crucial contributing factor to the canine global CPV pandemic in the late 1970s [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
