Although EV - D68 was first identified in California in 1962 , the number of people in one breakout in 2014 with confirmed EV - D68 infection was much greater than the number reported in previous years ( http : / / www . cdc . gov / non - polio - enterovirus / about / ev - d68 . html ) . It is hard to predict whether EV - D68 will emerge again in future outbreaks , but the value of resolving the pathogenic mechanism of EV - D68 is obvious . In this study , we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of EV - D68 to reveal the relationship between virus infection and the host cell cycle .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
