These average or assumed values might lead to uncertainties in the risk assessment results . In the likelihood analysis , all these uncertain variables were included in the quanta generation rate term , while the case that best fits the outcome of the real outbreak case was identified by the MLE [ 49 ] . As shown in Table 5 , the passengers are arranged into four groups ( with the index patient excluded ) according to their intake fractions obtained in the exposure assessment of case 1 ~ 3 ( Figure 6 ) , respectively . In the outbreak case , 17 of the 71 passengers involved in this investigation region are infected with SARS . They are also given in Table 5 and used in the likelihood analysis . By using Eq . ( 4 ) , the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rates ( 1 ~ 10 9 hr \u2212 1 ) are obtained for case 1 ~ 3 , as shown in Figure 10 . The estimated quanta generation rate of the index patient in the outbreak case is 0 . 141 million , 0 . 103 million and 0 . 127 million for case 1 ~ 3 , respectively . The likelihood of the no movement case is significantly larger than case 2 and 3 ( 0 . 414 comparing with 0 . 026 and 0 . 055 ) . So case 1 best fits the infection pattern of the real case among case 1 ~ 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
