In this non - PCV population , we observed that S . pneumoniae , human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A were the main microbial agents associated with pneumonia among children in Mali , independently of patient age , gender , period , and other pathogens . H . influenzae was not associated with pneumonia , but the vaccination rate against this bacteria , at least for the first dose , was above 85 % in both cases and controls . In addition , while most patients with S . pneumoniae by PCR in blood had also nasal carriage , frequently with the same serotype , positive S . pneumoniae test from nasal sample was not highly predictive of S . pneumoniae detection in blood , meaning that the bacteria was frequently not the cause of pneumonia .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
