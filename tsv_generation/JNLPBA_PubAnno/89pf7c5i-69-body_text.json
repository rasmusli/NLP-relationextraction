On the basis of these reported cases , prognosis appears to vary from good to poor . In fact , five cats died a few days or weeks after diagnosis [ 12 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 65 ] . Some were affected by chronic renal failure or hepatic disease , but the real influence of Leishmania infection on mortality was not clearly demonstrated in these cases [ 36 , 37 , 65 ] . In other cases , euthanasia was performed after diagnosis because of a rapid clinical worsening [ 54 , 57 , 62 ] or due to a concurrent neoplasia [ 13 ] . Post mortem evaluation was obtained in three cats that died or were euthanized shortly after diagnosis , and all of them had visceral dissemination of Leishmania amastigotes found in the spleen , lymph nodes , liver , stomach or in the large bowel [ 13 , 36 , 57 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
