A previous study of serotypes involved in invasive pneumococcal disease in Mali found that serotype 5 was the most prevalent ( 54 % ) [ 20 ] . It was also linked with pneumonia in our series . In other sub - Saharan African countries , serotype 1 was described as the most prevalent serotype of invasive pneumococcal disease [ 21 ] . It was the second serotype significantly associated with pneumonia in children in Mali . Thus , the introduction of PCV in routine immunization programs in Mali would substantially reduce pneumonia caused by S . pneumoniae because most serotypes eliciting pneumonia would be covered by the vaccine [ 22 ] . In addition , pneumococcal pneumonia seasonality was similar to that observed previously in Burkina Faso , a neighbouring country , in 2007 - 2011 with higher incidence during the dry season between January and May [ 23 ] . Interestingly , among the 4 microbial agents associated with pneumonia , 3 were viruses : human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus . Self et al . recently observed , in a pneumonia cases - control study implemented in hospitals of Utah , that detection respiratory syncytial virus , human metapneumovirus and influenza from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample of patients with pneumonia probably indicates an etiologic role [ 24 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
