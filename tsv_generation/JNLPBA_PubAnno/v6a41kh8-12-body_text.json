Trained fieldworkers referred children with respiratory complaints to the study clinic at the outpatient department ( OPD ) at Siddhi Memorial Hospital in Bhaktapur , and families could bring their children for free treatment at our clinic for common childhood illnesses . Children residing in Bhaktapur district , but outside the municipality , were only under such passive surveillance . Children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing ( LCI ) and classified according to the standard World Health Organization ( WHO ) algorithm for acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) [ 19 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with fast breathing , that is \u2265 50 breaths / min for children 2 to 11 months old , and \u2265 40 breaths / min for children \u2265 12 months old . Severe pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with LCI . Children with audible or auscultatory wheeze were given 2 doses of 2 . 5 mg nebulized salbutamol administered 15 min apart followed by reassessment after 30 min , which is in accordance with the revised WHO guidelines [ 20 ] . A child was included only if he or she had fast breathing or LCI at reassessment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
