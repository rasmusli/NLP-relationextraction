Echinococcus multilocularis ( Hegglin et al . 2015 ) , SARS coronavirus ( Bell and Roberton 2004 ) , avian influenza ( Fouchier et al . 2004 ) , hantavirus ( Watson et al . 2014 ) and Ebola ( Leroy et al . 2005 ) . Wildlife disease surveillance thus forms an essential part of the ' One Health ' theme ( Thompson 2013 ) , with studies providing an opportunity to both benefit human health and the wildlife species in question ( Jenkins et al . 2015 ) . To minimise transmission of pathogens between wildlife and livestock or humans , it is necessary to understand the species ' ecology and pathogen transmission pathways ( Boadella et al . 2011 ; Delahay et al . 2009 ) . Any investigation of host - pathogen dynamics relies on a sensitive and specific detection assay ( Boadella et al . 2011 ) , and yet application of current molecular techniques to wildlife disease epidemiology has been slow in comparison with studies of humans and livestock ( Benton et al . 2015 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
