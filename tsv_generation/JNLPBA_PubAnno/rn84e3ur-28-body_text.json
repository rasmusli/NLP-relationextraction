In steady - state , the cold air comes into the airplane cabin from the supply inlets , flows downward and sideward through the cabin and exits from the outlets located at the bottom of the sidewalls . No symmetrical recirculation zone exists , unlike the airflow pattern in the twin - aisle airplane [ 18 , 19 , 22 ] . Downward airflow can be found on both sides of the aisle , which is induced by the ventilation system . The human thermal plume is not apparent because of the significant downward airflow induced by the ventilation system . The heat effects of the human body can influence the temperature distribution in the local area around the human body . The influence area of these downward airflow is also larger than that of the respiratory exhalation flows of the seated passengers , which indicates that the influence of the personal respiratory exhalation flows of the seated passengers on the airflow field is insignificant comparing with that induced by the ventilation system . When the standing person moves along the aisle , the airflow pattern in the airplane is affected by human movement , similar to the results given by previous studies [ 8 , 11 ] . Significant downward airflow exists in the wake behind the torso , which enhances the downward movement of the room air induced by the ventilation system . Hence human movement can disturb the air distribution in a local region and influence the airflow motion in the airplane cabin . More details about the airflow pattern in the airplane cabin , and discussions on the human thermal plume and the effects of human movement on the flow field can be found in the Additional file 1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
