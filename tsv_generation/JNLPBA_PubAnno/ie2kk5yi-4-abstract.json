Bats have been implicated as a likely reservoir host for these bacteria , but little is known about how prevalence varies over time , routes of transmission , and the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bats . We present results from a two - year , spatially replicated study of common vampire bats , which have previously shown high infection prevalence of Bartonella and could pose risks of cross - species transmission due to their diet of mammal blood . We found that vampire bat Bartonella is genetically diverse , geographically widespread and endemic , and that individual - level infection risk is highest for large , male , non - reproductive bats . Phylogenetic analysis supported vector - borne transmission , and we found support for potential transmission through direct contact and fecal exposures through PCR . Confirming whether arthropod vectors are the main route of transmission for bat Bartonella is needed for understanding infection dynamics in bats and for predicting risks of cross - species transmission to humans and livestock .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
