Thus , the pricing structure makes colistin particularly attractive for use in pig production . Since the inception of its clinical use in 1960 , colistin has been used in pig production in many countries for the treatment and prevention of digestive disorders caused by Enterobacteriaceae , and even sometimes for growth promotion over long periods , to improve growth rate and feed conversion efficiency in pigs [ 18 , 69 , 70 ] . In certain countries such as Canada , where colistin has not been approved for use in pigs , a rapid increase in resistance of ETEC to a wide range of antimicrobials has prompted the use of colistin in weaned pigs under the veterinarian ' s responsibility [ 71 ] . However , current data on the total quantities of colistin used in pigs worldwide have been difficult to obtain accurately [ 70 ] . Some data , for example in Denmark , indicate that the use of colistin for the treatment of sows increased between 2002 and 2008 [ 72 ] . Of the two forms of colistin commercially available , colistin sulfate ( CS ) and colistin methanesulphonate sodium ( CMS ) , and only CS is approved in pig production in some countries [ 18 ] . Usually it is administered orally in the drinking water at the dose of 50 , 000 IU / kg body weight every 12 h for 3 or 5 days [ 25 ] . Colistin is mostly used in monotherapy in pigs , although it may be combined with other antimicrobials , such as amoxicillin , for the treatment of PWD [ 25 , 73 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
