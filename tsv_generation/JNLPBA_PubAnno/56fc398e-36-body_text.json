Significant work has been done in the UK to predict the potential for disease spread through the livestock network [ 12 , 17 , 18 ] owing to the existence of the CTS and the animal movement licence scheme . In many other countries around the world , the lack of such databases means that it is impossible to develop a model that uses precise movement data , and an alternative approach must be used . In such countries , it may be impossible to ever record all movement data either owing to the sheer size of the industry ( in countries such as the USA ) or owing to the cost associated with implementing an animal licence scheme . However , a more limited data collection scheme may be possible , whereby movements are recorded for a subset of the livestock movement network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
