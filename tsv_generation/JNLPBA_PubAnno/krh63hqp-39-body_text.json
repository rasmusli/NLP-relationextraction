{"cord_uid": "krh63hqp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3507676", "divid": "39", "text": "During the last 100 years , the H1N1 influenza genome has diverged from the original genotype by roughly 15 % . Might the approximately 1 , 900 nucleotide substitutions be primarily attributed to the genetic drift of perfectly neutral variations ? This seems unlikely for several reasons . First , a viral genome of approximately 13 , 000 nucleotides does not have room for very much neutral RNA . Not only did 15 % of the genome change , but polymorphisms arose across more than 50 % of the genome . This strongly points to extreme mutational pressure , high enough , reasonably , to threaten error catastrophe . Second , if some significant portions of the viral genome are neutral , deletions of such portions of the viral genome should be regularly seen , and selection should favor such deletions , rapidly producing smaller genomes . There is no evidence of significantly smaller influenza genomes . Indeed , there is little evidence of deletion in any of the 2009 - 2010 genomes compared to the 1918 version . The only major indels occurred among the oldest samples ( prior to 1948 ) in the sixth genomic segment ( neuraminidase , or NA ) , but all of these represented deletions compared to the 1918 genome and all later genomes . Third , it is now known that even synonymous mutations are not always neutral . Even though they may not directly affect protein sequence , they can affect RNA stability , RNA architecture , speed of translation , and protein folding . Fourth , there should only be a finite number of nucleotide positions that are perfectly neutral . Because of this , neutral divergence should quickly approach a limit , causing the rate of divergence from the original genotype to slow , but this is not seen . Finally , the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral ; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline , attenuation , extinction of most circulating strains , and even more frequent sub - lineage extinction events .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 672}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 904}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 966, "end": 986}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1098, "end": 1120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1122, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1141, "end": 1144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1203, "end": 1215}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
