{"cord_uid": "6i7b1i5x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6514959", "divid": "26", "text": "The roll of B cells and plasma cells in KD is controversial ( summarized Table 3 ) . Much of the B cell and antibody data reviewed herein show inconsistent , contradictory or unsubstantiated findings . Pathological specimens and model systems are variably supportive or inconsistent with what is known from human studies . Although B cell and plasma cell infiltration in pathology specimens is intriguing , whether they are bystanders activated by a superantigen effect , are responding to a self - antigen revealed by inflammation , or specific against an infectious etiology , is currently unknown . Like the mouse models and attempts at developing new therapeutics , it is hard to be confident in any one approach without knowledge of the etiology . Although published B cell studies relating to KD are somewhat inconsistent , recent data using advanced sequencing techniques show promise for identification of an etiology . Since KD is a clinical syndrome without a definitive marker of diagnosis , many of the studies may be influenced by \" generous \" case definitions of the study participants . Most of the studies reviewed do not include detailed clinical information or rigorous case definitions . This is a general problem with the literature in this field ; these machinations seem more consistent in clinical trials and epidemiological studies but are rare in bench - science studies . This potential selection bias may be negatively influencing reproducible , definitive findings and conclusions . This is a rich opportunity for clinical investigators . Rigorous studies are needed on those children who present with KD . If any pulmonary findings are found , bronchial washings should be obtained and stored for potential molecular diagnostics . Other samples , such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum , should be taken and banked for future studies . Thorough autopsy evaluation should be pursued on any subjects who succumb during the acute or convalescent phases of KD . Improved reporting and national registries would go a long way in establishing a representative pool of patients . Studies currently ongoing on peripheral cytokine profiles , B cells and PBs may show a consistent marker to help define who has KD . A correlative diagnostic marker , possibly even antibody derived , would be a highly desirable first step in future studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 507}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 2156, "end": 2165}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
