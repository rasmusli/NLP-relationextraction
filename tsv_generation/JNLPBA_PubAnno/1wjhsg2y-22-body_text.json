Not surprisingly , overall bat research per country was positively correlated with bat species richness ( r = 0 . 45 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table S3 ) , however many areas of central Africa and Southeast Asia with high species richness had a very low overall number of publications on bats . Globally , nearly half of all countries had less than five bat - related publications indexed in PubMed ( 42 % , see Table S4 ) . Western Asia , together with much of Africa , had some of the lowest numbers of bat - related publications , with a few exceptions . While half of all Western Asian countries have 10 or fewer publications on bats , a few countries reported relatively high publication counts , specifically Turkey and Israel ( 110 and 533 publications , respectively ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
