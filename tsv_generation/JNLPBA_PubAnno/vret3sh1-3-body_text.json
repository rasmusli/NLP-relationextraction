Today , tens of thousands of genomes are being sequenced by public and private institutions around the globe [ 3 , 4 ] , and whole - genome sequencing / re - sequencing has become a routine step of virtually any analysis of microbial behavior . In some fields , researchers are sequencing hundreds of genomes from distant taxa [ 5 ] to explore microbial diversity , while elsewhere , hundreds of closely related genomes are being sequenced to understand environmental adaptation , to support pangenome reconstruction [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] , and to build maps of microbial variomes [ 9 ] . Sequencing is also being applied to aid in solving urgent biological problems , including the development of strategies to combat emerging or reemerging biothreats , such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) virus [ 10 ] , the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [ 11 , 12 ] , and the 2011 German Escherichia coli outbreak [ 13 , 14 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
