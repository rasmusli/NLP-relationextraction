Our BLAST procedure also identified weakly related Bartonella from rodents ( e . g . , 90 % to Rattus norvegicus from the United States [ KC763951 ] and 92 % to Apodemus agrarius from China [ KX549996 ] ) and from carnivores ( e . g . , 89 % to Procyon lotor from the United States [ CP019786 ] ) . However , these livestock , rodent , and carnivore sequences formed separate phylogenetic clades from bat - and bat flyderived Bartonella sequences ( Fig 3 ) . Despite the geographic proximity of our field sites to Brazil , our BLAST procedure found no Bartonella seqeunces similar to those recently described in Brazilian bat or rodent species [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] . An additional phylogenetic tree that includes these recently identified Bartonella is provided in S1 Fig .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
