This pattern may reflect waning maternal immunity lagging two to three months behind the peak kitten births . Similar seasonality of FPL outbreaks was reported in the Northern Hemisphere , where seasons are inverted ; case numbers peaked from July to December and were correlated with an influx of kittens born annually in spring and waning of maternal immunity over the subsequent two to three months [ 43 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
