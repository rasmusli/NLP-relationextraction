The sequence data obtained from samples collected between 1995 - 1996 differed from the 2003 - 10 samples by four amino acid changes in the G protein ; L12Q , D427G , P485L , and S501P , and each involved a change in polarity ( Table 2 ) . One amino acid change , G428S , characterized samples obtained from the southern region versus from the northern region . Samples from Arcata were also defined by nucleotide changes and samples from the southern region of Humboldt Co . , Loleta , Fortuna , and Hydesville , grouped together as did most of the Eureka samples ( Figure 3 , Figure S5 ) . The exceptions were Fx44 from mid Eureka and Fx34 from just east of Eureka , which consistently grouped with the Arcata samples ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Figure S6 ) . Skunk 2 from 1995 differed from all other samples at site 69 where a Y was present rather than an H ( Table 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 235}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
