According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence , providing patients with such a plan is a quality indicator and can improve outcomes such as self - efficacy , knowledge , and confidence for people with asthma . In those who have had a recent exacerbation , resulting in admission to hospital , it may reduce readmission rates [ 31 ] . Quite recently , a survey was conducted among 277 pediatricians in 6 European countries to assess the care for asthmatic children in the outpatients ' setting in terms of therapeutic education ; it turned out that 80 % of the sampled patients received a personalized action plan during the visit ( 83 % in Italy ) [ 32 ] . Several papers consider the availability of an individualized action plan among the interventions that can help reducing ED visits for acute asthma [ 2 , 20 , 21 ] . Some authors also suggest the use of electronic action plans that might be delivered to the patients at ED discharge [ 33 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
