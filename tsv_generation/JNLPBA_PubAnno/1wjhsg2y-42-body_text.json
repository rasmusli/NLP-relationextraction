Regional scientific collaborations can strengthen diplomatic relationships , foster exchange of knowledge and resources among researchers , and inform regional policies to address shared threats . This is particularly important in regions identified as potential zoonotic disease hotspots that have largely been overlooked , such is the case for Western Asia . To fulfil this regional gap , EcoHealth Alliance ( EHA ) , a global non - profit organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and public health , formed the Western Asia Bat Research Network ( WAB - Net , \" wah - bee - net \" ) in collaboration with key regional stakeholders in Western Asia in 2018 . The WAB - Net aims to promote collaborative research to improve regional capacity for One Health approaches to mitigate threats to bat populations that also facilitate viral spillover . Given the challenges and research opportunities identified for Western Asia above , there is a critical need to link bat research with public health initiatives in order to achieve \" win - win \" solutions for bat conservation and zoonotic disease prevention .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
