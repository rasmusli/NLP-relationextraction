The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered . The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers . Conclusions : The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient . The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks . Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important . For future studies , investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
