Half of our Peruvian and Belizian sequences ( 18 / 35 ) were nearly identical ( > 99 . 7 % identity ) to Bartonella from common vampire bats ( Desmodus rotundus ) from Mexico ( e . g . , GenBank accession numbers KY629837 and MF467803 ) , again confirming the wide geographic distribution of these genotypes . Other sequences ( 9 / 35 ) fell within the same clade ( > 96 % pairwise identity ) as Bartonella from bat flies ( Strebla diaemi ) in Panama ( JX416251 ) , from Parnell ' s mustached bat ( Pteronotus parnellii ) in Mexico ( e . g . , KY629828 ) , from phytophagous bats in Peru ( e . g . , Carollia perspicillata ; JQ071384 ) and Guatemala ( e . g . , Glossophaga soricina ; HM597202 ) , or from Mexican vampire bats as noted above . Eight sequences were novel ( < 96 % identity to GenBank sequences ) but were most similar to Bartonella from phytophagous bats in Costa Rica ( e . g . , 90 - 93 % to KJ816666 [ Anoura geoffroyi ] ) and from Mexican vampire bats ( e . g . , 93 % to MF467776 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
