Spayed females represented 62 % ( n = 6 ) and 40 % ( n = 6 ) , while neutered males represented 38 % ( n = 5 ) and 60 % ( n = 9 ) of cats fed Diets A and B , respectively . Mean body weight was 4 . 9 kg ( SD = 1 . 3 , range 3 . 0 - 7 . 3 ) and 4 . 6 kg ( SD = 1 . 2 , range 2 . 9 - 7 . 0 ) ; and mean BCS was 3 . 2 ( SD = 0 . 6 , range 2 - 4 ) and 3 . 1 ( SD = 0 . 6 , range 2 - 4 ) on a 5 - point scale in cats fed Diets A and B , respectively . Results of the PCR fecal panel showed that 16 of the 28 cats ( Diet A n = 9 ; Diet B n = 7 ) tested positive for C . perfringens enterotoxin gene ; 1 cat ( Diet A n = 1 ; Diet B n = 0 ) tested positive for C . coli ; and 17 cats ( Diet A n = 9 ; Diet B n = 8 ) tested positive for FCoV . Eighteen of the 28 cats ( Diet A n = 10 ; Diet B n = 8 ) tested positive for FCoV antibody . There were no statistically differences in the baseline characteristics of the cats between diet groups , and diagnostic screenings showed no clinically meaningful differences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 714, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
