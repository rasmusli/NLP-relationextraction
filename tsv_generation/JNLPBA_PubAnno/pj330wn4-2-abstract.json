While direct measurement of beat frequency from high - speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming . The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video ( AVI ) files that runs on open - source software ( ImageJ ) coupled to Microsoft Excel , and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high - speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia . These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
