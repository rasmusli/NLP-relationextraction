By isolating DFMO escape mutants , we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which polyamines function in virus infection . Here , we have isolated two protease mutants following passage of CVB3 in DFMO . We previously characterized escape mutants for chikungunya virus and found three mutations that conferred resistance when simultaneously present in the virus [ 31 ] . In contrast , we find that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO with a single mutation in either protease . From our data , we cannot determine whether polyamines facilitate protease activity against a specific target ; however , we observe that both viral proteases maintain activity in polyamine - depleted cells with either of these mutations and that these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment . Determining the specificity of this activity is an area of important future investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 280}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 573, "end": 582}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 659}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 727, "end": 743}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
