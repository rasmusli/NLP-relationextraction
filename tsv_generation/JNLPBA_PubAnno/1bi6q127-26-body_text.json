Little brown bats are particularly susceptible to a frequently lethal fungal infection known as the white nose syndrome , caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] . A study looking at the effects of white - nose syndrome fungus on a persistently infecting coronavirus showed that bats having the fungal infection in wings had 60 times more coronavirus in their intestines as compared to fungal uninfected bats [ 62 ] . The intestines of the fungus - infected bats exhibited a gene expression profile suggesting suppression of the innate antiviral response , which may have contributed to unrestrained viral replication . This suggests that secondary infections in bats persistently infected with viruses could increase the potential of viral shedding .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
