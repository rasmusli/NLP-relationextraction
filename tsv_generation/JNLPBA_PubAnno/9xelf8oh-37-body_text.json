All three red squirrels that had died from causes other than skin lesions , gastrointestinal lesions or road causalities showed evidence of SADV infection . The two squirrels with severe pediculosis had SADV consistently identified in multiple tissue types , albeit at relatively low levels . The cause of death of these two squirrels was thought to be due to anaemia , It should be noted that the swab / blood samples appear to be superior to tissue samples in all instances apart from adenovirus in red squirrels when using the qPCR developed in this study secondary to parasitism ( Duff et al . 2010 ; Larose et al . 2010 ; Simpson et al . 2013b ) . However , haemorrhage has been reported in 70 % ( 7 / 10 ) of case studies of SADV infection ( Martinez - Jimenez et al . 2011 ) . The prevalence of SADV in lice found on infected individuals was 80 % ( 4 / 5 : 95 % CI , 30 - 99 % ) , which combined with the relatively high occurrence of viral DNA in blood ( 67 % ( 6 / 9 ) ; 95 % CI 31 - 91 % ) may suggest a potential role of the parasite in pathogen transmission . Additionally , the red squirrel that had pneumonia also showed SADV DNA presence in all tissues analysed . The lung RQ value was the highest recorded in any infected individual ( 12 . 52 ) , and , indeed , viral prevalence in lung tissue was relatively common in infected individuals ( 64 % , 7 / 11 ; 95 % CI , 32 - 88 % ) ( Fig . 3 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1006}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
