Association with meteorological factors has not previously been described for this virus . Belonging to the Pneumovirinae subfamily [ 53 ] , both RSV and hMPV could require similar conditions for transmission and infectivity . In contrast , PIV3 was strongly and positively correlated with both temperature and rainfall , but not with relative humidity . A study in Singapore found no such associations for PIV3 [ 54 ] . It is also interesting to note that , in our study , InfB infections showed an inverse correlation with relative humidity , temperature and rainfall , while InfA infections did not correlate with any of these meteorological factors . In Singapore , InfA outbreaks were also not associated with meteorological factors , but InfB infections were reported to positively correlate with rainfall [ 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
