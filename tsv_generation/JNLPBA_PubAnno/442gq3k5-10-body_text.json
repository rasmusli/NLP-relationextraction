This questionnaire was developed in Vietnamese and validated at HTD and consisted of four parts ; socio - demographic and cultural factors , medical history , potential exposure to pigs or pork and culinary habits and hygiene measures . We hypothesized that consumption of ' ' high risk ' ' food dishes ( Table 2 ) , potentially contaminated with S . suis , could function as a source of infection . The majority of the questions were ' ' closed questions ' ' but ' ' open questions ' ' which allowed participants to explain in their own words were also included . Patients and hospital controls were interviewed when they were fully conscious . The questionnaire was filled in by structured interview , which was carried out by one of two research nurses on the ward for cases and hospital controls , or at the residency of community controls . The interviewers were blinded towards the diagnosis of the patient in the case and hospital control groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
