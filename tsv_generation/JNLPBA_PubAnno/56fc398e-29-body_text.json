The robustness of a sampling method is determined by whether the mean simulation for a method using a certain percentage of data lies within the 95 % CIs of the mean of simulations run in the full network . We focus on key epidemiological quantities such as final size , peak size and epidemic duration . While it is informative to explore the effect of partial knowledge upon epidemic duration , for rspb . royalsocietypublishing . org Proc . R . Soc . B 282 : 20150205 many diseases livestock movement bans will be implemented as soon as cases are reported . We therefore also look at predictions of the epidemic size after 6 and 12 weeks using the different sampling methods . We denote the threshold at which a scheme fails to be robust as S min , the minimum sampling threshold . Initially , we set b \u00bc 1 and T \u00bc 21 days . Sensitivity to these parameter values is explored below ( electronic supplementary material , figures S13 - S16 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
