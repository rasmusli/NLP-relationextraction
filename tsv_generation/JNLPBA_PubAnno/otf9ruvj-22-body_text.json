In 11 IVIG patients , bacterial pathogens such as Legionella ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , Pneumocystis jirovecii ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , and Mycoplasma ( n = 1 ) were identified in BAL samples . Viral infections were more frequent in the IVIG group ( p = 0 . 046 ; Pearson ' s chi - squared test ) , especially influenza infection ( p < 0 . 05 ) . In more than half of the IVIG patients , viral pneumonia was diagnosed according to the results of BAL samples , radiological findings , and clinical symptoms . One or more of the following viruses could be detected in BAL samples : influenza ( n = 10 ; 36 % ) and herpes virus ( n = 9 ; 32 % ) . Herpes virus infection included HSV ( n = 7 ; 25 % ) , CMV ( n = 2 ; 7 % ) , and HHV6 ( in BAL and blood ; n = 1 ) . In 7 of the IVIG - treated patients , fungal infection was diagnosed in urinary tract ( n = 4 ) and abdominal samples ( n = 2 ) . In addition , one patient suffered aspergillosis pneumonia . In three IVIGpatients , no causal pathogen could be identified ( 11 % ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
