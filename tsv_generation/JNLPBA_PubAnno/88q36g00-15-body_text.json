In this model , the social behavior including sociability and social novelty preference was impaired . The number of oligodendrocytes in the amygdala , cerebral cortex , and white matter in the offspring was decreased , which is consistent with previous findings 47 ; and a reduced number of neurons in the amygdala and cortex was also observed . Strong evidence suggests a crucial involvement of the amygdala in social processing and social cognition in humans [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] , as well as in social behavior in animals [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] . A recent report also suggested an association between the function of the cortex and the amygdala , and social behavior 54 . Therefore , the social behavior impairment observed in the present study is compatible with the neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex . A locomotor test was not performed in this study , although we observed no apparent differences in speed of movement among all groups in the three - chamber social test . Interestingly , there were no remarkable differences in the PPI test in our MIA model , and sensorimotor gating was also normal in comparison with the Control group . A possible explanation for these results is that PPI abnormalities might occur following exposure to a pathogen at mid - gestation 55 , while impairments in short - term memory and social behavior might be independent of the timing of exposure to a pathogen 2 . Thus , the negative results of the PPI test might be due to the fact that in the present model , LPS exposure occurs at late gestation , on embryonic day 17 ( E17 ) . Impairments in short - term memory and social behavior are well described in schizophrenia and ASD 38 , 56 . PPI impairments manifest primarily in adults with ASD 57 , and are not observed in children with ASD 58 . A recent study further suggested that sensorimotor gating is only impaired in certain ASD subgroups 59 , although it may be a globally common feature in schizophrenia 60 . Therefore , the present model may reflect ASD - like rather than schizophrenia - like behavioral impairments .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
