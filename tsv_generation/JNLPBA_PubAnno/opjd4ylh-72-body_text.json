TB nurses are on the frontline of the fight against the highly infectious diseases that affect many people . In spite of this , they do not receive a danger allowance and the hospital does not celebrate TB day as a way of appreciating TB nurses as pioneers in the hospitals who risk their lives in order to fight TB disease . In support of these findings , Loghmani et al . [ 29 ] reported that the participants ' experiences were that the families believed that nurses did not do their best for the patients and that they abused the patients . The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Sodeify et al . [ 30 ] , which concluded that South African nurses were not well supported , appreciated , recognized , and well - rewarded ; unlike in other countries since they provide quality service to patients under very difficult circumstances with limited resources . This is why they leave South Africa to work in other countries .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
