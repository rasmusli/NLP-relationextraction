According to the study that was done by Washeya [ 15 ] , it is important that the working environment enhances productivity . The findings of this study indicated that there was a poor practice environment in the TB wards . There was also an inadequate supply of personal protective materials . This leads to negative practice by the nurses , since they are afraid to contract diseases . The findings of the present study concur with those of a study that was done by Mametja [ 16 ] , which indicated that there was a more negative practice environment in HIV / AIDS wards which affected the quality of nursing care in the public hospital .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
