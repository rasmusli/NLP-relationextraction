We provide strong evidence of multiple outbreaks of FPL in three countries . There are no previous published reports of FPL outbreaks in any of these regions for comparison , although there is anecdotal first - hand experience of FPL among veterinarians practicing in Australia from the late 1960s to the mid - 1970s , before commercial vaccines were used routinely [ 1 ] . Despite the widespread circulation of CPV in Australia , this virus was not detected in any samples tested in these FPL outbreaks . Canine parvovirus causes approximately 5 % of FPL cases globally , but these have been confined to sporadic individual cases , and there are no reports of FPL outbreaks caused by CPV in multi - cat environments [ 8 , 15 , 16 ] . Whether this is due to viral or to host factors is currently unknown and warrants further investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
