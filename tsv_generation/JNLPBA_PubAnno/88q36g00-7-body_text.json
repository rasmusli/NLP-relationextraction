During the habituation phase , the mice in each group spent equal amounts of time exploring both compartments , with no biased preference for either of the two empty cylinders ( data not shown ) . During the sociability phase , the mice in each group demonstrated a preference for spending more time in the chamber containing an unfamiliar mouse ( stranger 1 ) relative to the opposite , empty chamber . However , the LPS - treated offspring approached the chamber containing stranger 1 significantly less frequently than the Control and HW + LPS groups ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 01 , respectively ; Fig . 2C ) . During the social novelty preference phase , the mice in each group showed a significant preference for the new , unfamiliar mouse ( stranger 2 ) over the previous , now familiar , mouse ( stranger 1 ) . However , the LPS - treated offspring approached the chamber containing the stranger 2 significantly less frequently than the Control group ( p < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 2D ) . There was no difference between the LPS and the HW + LPS groups , although a trend toward attenuation of the LPS - induced reduction in the preference for social novelty was detected in the HW + LPS group .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
