The reported flaviviruses , all described as mosquito borne , include at least JEV , WNV , SLEV , yellow fever virus , ZIKV , Spondweni virus , WESSV , TMUV , and dengue virus ( DENV ) , and the species concerned include pigs , humans , nonhuman primates , mice , guinea pigs , hamsters , geese , partridges , ducks , several other species of birds , and even alligators ( 8 , 9 , 12 , 15 - 17 , 20 - 22 , 24 - 27 , 46 - 54 ) . Some of these reports are from experimental studies , and others are from field observations , laboratory infections , or infections of exposed health care providers or animal caretakers . Despite this multitude of reports , nothing is known about the mechanisms leading to such routes of transmission . For nonlaboratory exposures , a first prerequisite for aerosol contact transmission would be that the virus is secreted into body fluids such as mucosal secretions or urine . In fact , this has been described in many of the references previously cited , but the source of virus and first target remained unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
