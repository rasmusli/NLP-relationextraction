We included categorical livestock biomass as a predictor in the GLMM to control for a previously observed negative association with Bartonella infection ( 121 / 173 positive bats ) [ 49 ] . We fit this GLMM to a reduced dataset free of missing values ( n = 189 ) , included bat ID nested within site as a random effect , and calculated marginal R 2 ( R 2 m ) to assess model fit [ 62 ] . Finally , for a data subset ( n = 40 bats sampled in Peru in 2016 ) , we fit two separate GLMs with bat fly intensity and presence as predictors to test whether ectoparasites explained Bartonella infection status . We fit a separate GLM with quasi - Poisson errors to test for sex and age differences in bat fly intensity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
