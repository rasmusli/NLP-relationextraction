As the network fragments , the size of the GSCC decreases while the number of strongly connected components increases . Both the TNS and SBS sampling schemes outperform the RNS scheme in preserving robustness across all measured statistics as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases ( figure 1 ) . Within the giant component , the mean degree and degree standard deviation remain robust with approximately 15 - 20 % of the data for both TNS and SBS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 202}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
