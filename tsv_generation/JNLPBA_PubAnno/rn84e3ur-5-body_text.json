Significant works have been done on this issue , as summarized in Table 1 . In experimental investigations , Matsumoto and Ohba [ 10 ] , Poussou et al . [ 11 ] and Bj\u00f8rn and Nielsen [ 12 ] showed that human movement inside enclosed environments could significantly influence contaminant transport and personal exposures to contaminants . By using Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) methods , more studies were performed in different indoor environments . Simple human models [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and realistic walking human models [ 16 , 17 ] were used as the walking humans in the simulations . Most of these studies [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 ] used tracer gas as the contaminant , but gaseous contaminants were not accurate enough to represent the transmission of respiration droplets . Wang and Chow [ 17 ] and Choi and Edwards [ 15 , 16 ] studied the influence of human walking on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets in indoor environment . Among previous literatures , significant differences can be found in their methods and conclusions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
