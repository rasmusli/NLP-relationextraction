Figure 6 displays the difference of actual specificity ( calculated using the training data ) and the nominal specificity ( predetermined 1 - \u03b1 ) for different values of \u03b1 . Curves above or below the horizontal dotted line at zero , indicate departures from the nominal \u03b1 . The Chicago series preserves the nominal value of the specificity ( curves are clustered around the zero line ) . For the Minneapolis - St . Paul series the actual specificity is biased downwards , and for the other cities , the departure from the nominal value changes as \u03b1 increases . The choice of filter affected the calibration . To understand the tradeoff between the specificity and the sensitivity we show the receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curves , for each city , in Figure 7 . For all cities , the 1 - day filter has the poorest sensitivity . Except for Milwaukee , the 7 - day filter tends to have higher sensitivities compared to the other filters , but also tends to have the poorest specificity . The exponential filter balances the specificity - sensitivity tradeoff . Tables 2 and 3 display , respectively , the median and maximum detection times for each filter and city for our model . The 1 - day filter performed poorly . The other filters are more comparable . We observed ( results not shown ) that the time to detection increases if the attack rate is reduced and also if the probabilities of entering the ED is delayed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
