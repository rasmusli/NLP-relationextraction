Numerous regional networks of bat research experts have been established around the world [ 4 , 21 ] ( Figure 1 ) . There are a number of advantages that coordinated , regional bat research initiatives have over country - specific efforts , specifically the ability to take effective action on shared threats spanning geographical , temporal , and disciplinary scales [ 21 ] . Bats are highly mobile , and often have geographic distributions that extend across political boundaries . Without regional collaborations , conservation efforts in one country may be insufficient to counteract the threats towards a species elsewhere in its range [ 57 ] . In just the same way , viruses with mobile hosts can be easily spread across borders and require cooperation among a broad array of experts to ensure the reduced risk of spillover and spread [ 78 ] . Moreover , bats are long - lived and therefore require long - term studies that can withstand funding shortages and changes in government priorities and policies [ 21 ] . Finally , bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse , and known reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses with zoonotic potential [ 34 ] . How , then , can zoonotic disease surveillance programs best leverage the expertise of bat ecologists and conservationists to more fully understand the basic ecology of host species ? Furthermore , in return , how can bat experts learn from disease experts to understand the role of human threats in altering host - virus dynamics ?
