A sterile cotton flocked swab was soaked in saline and then placed approximately 1 to 1 . 5 cm into the nostrils and rotated against the anterior nasal mucosa for 3 seconds . The procedure was repeated using another swab . One of the 2 NSs was placed into viral transport media ( VTM ) ( DMEM , Gibco - BRL , Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ; penicillin 10 , 000 U / ml , and streptomycin 10 , 000 IU / ml , BioWhittaker , MA ; NaHCO 3 ; HEPES buffer , 1M , Gibco ; L - Glutamate 200 mM ; Fungizone ( Amphotericin B ) 250 \u03bcg / ml ; bovine serum albumin , Fraction V , 7 . 5 % , Gibco ) for detection of viral pathogens , whereas the other one was placed in STGG ( skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol ) media for bacterial culture . The collected specimens were immediately placed at 2 - 8 [UNK] C and transported to IDESHI laboratory . The specimens had been collected before the patients received any antibiotic treatment at the hospital . Specimens that had been collected in STGG media were subjected to a bacterial culture within 4 hours of collection , whereas specimens in VTM were stored at - 70 [UNK] C for later detection of viral pathogens by RT - qPCR .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 633, "end": 654}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
