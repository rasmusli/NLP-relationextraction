By establishing a common database and data collection standards , networks make it easier for their members to engage in collaborative projects and to leverage additional resources that may be useful in one ' s research . Members are encouraged to share data with others in the network but are also allowed the option to withhold certain information as deemed necessary . An important consideration , therefore , when creating a database is to develop data sharing agreements between network members . A good example of this is the EIDITH web - based database developed to collate and curate data for the USAID PREDICT project that operates in \u2248 30 countries around the world [ 152 ] . Such databases are only successful if network participants contribute in a trusting manner . Willingness to share data may be facilitated by individual or country - level security settings that enable restricted access to particular data or datasets , thereby alleviating national concerns about the sharing of potentially sensitive information .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
