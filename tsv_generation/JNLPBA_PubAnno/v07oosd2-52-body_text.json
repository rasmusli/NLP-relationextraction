In addition , it was shown that the feeding of pigs with live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhanced their growth and reduced the duration and the severity of PWD caused by ETEC [ 131 ] . It has been demonstrated that the administration of a mixture of two probiotics , Pediococcus acidilactici and Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii , in the feed of challenged weaned pigs reduced ETEC : F4 attachment to the ileal mucosa in comparison with the group treated with chlortetracycline and tiamulin [ 103 ] . Synbiotics refers to a combination of probiotic and prebiotic approaches ; it is possible that a prebiotic that confers gastrointestinal health benefits could selectively increase the population and / or activity of probiotics in the gut [ 132 ] . Synbiotics can be either complementary or synergistic . Complementary synbiotics consist of a probiotic and a prebiotic selected independently to confer benefits to the host . On the other hand , synergistic synbiotics are comprised of a prebiotic chosen specifically for the selected probiotic to potentiate its effect in the gut [ 133 ] . It was shown that the combination of raw potato starch and a probiotic had a beneficial effect on pig growth performance and resulted in a reduction of diarrhea and increased microbial diversity in the gut of weaned pigs challenged with an ETEC : F4 strain [ 134 ] . Also , Guerra - Ordaz et al . [ 135 ] showed that following a challenge of pigs with pathogenic E . coli ( O149 : K91 : H10 ) , administration of a prebiotic oligosaccharide , lactulose , in the feed resulted in improved weight gain , increased lactobacilli and the proportion of butyric acid in the colon , and less inflammation due to a reduction of the pig major acutephase protein ( Pig - MAP ) in serum . Administration of Lactobacillus plantarum in the feed promoted lactobacilli growth , modulated fermentative activity , reduced inflammation , and improved intestinal mucosa function and showed a tendency to reduce diarrhea . The application of a synbiotic diet resulted in the benefits of both diet regimes , thus being an example of a complementary synbiotic [ 135 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1805, "end": 1834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1836, "end": 1846}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
