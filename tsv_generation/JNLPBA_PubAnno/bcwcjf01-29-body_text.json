This is supported by the fact Although relatively few amino acid changes were associated with the 2003 / 10 host jump , it is possible that one or more of these changes may have been required for efficient transmission of the virus in the local gray fox population . Despite an extensive search of the rabies virus literature , none of these amino acid changes were described by other studies as being associated with a change in viral phenotype . Transmission studies using reverse genetics are required to identify which genetic changes are responsible for increased transmissibility . Information from this type of analysis may provide important information on the risk of a similar host jump occurring in other regions , including regions where gray foxes overlap with populations of mesocarnivores that have threatened or endangered status .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
