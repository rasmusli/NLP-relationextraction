Researchers have tried to understand pandemic potential of MERS - CoV by studying its emergence and ecology . Studies are being carrying out to assess how this virus causes disease so that novel therapeutics and vaccines can be developed . The mode of transmission of MERS - CoV is yet to be established , but it is assumed to have come from bats [ 13 ] . Camels found in the Arabian Peninsula may serve as intermediate hosts for human infection [ 14 ] . This review will focus on studies trying to elucidate mechanisms by which MERS - CoV escapes host - immune system and causes disease . We will also examine the recent advances in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines . Figure 1 vitro studies . Studies were conducted on animal models and human lung cell lines , and the account from a single autopsy [ 43 ] . In vitro studies revealed that MERS - CoV can easily replicate in several cultured human cells , as well as , in the differentiated and nondifferentiated human epithelial cells [ 34 , 44 ] . The antigens of MERS - CoV were found on the macrophages in the alveoli of the infected human lung explants , ciliated and nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells , endothelial cells and pneumocytes [ 33 , 45 ] . These findings were in sync with the findings made in the single autopsy where MERS - CoV antigen was detected on pneumocytes , endothelial cells and epithelial cells of the airways and few on macrophages [ 43 , 45 ] . Macrophages are the important phagocytic cells of innate immune system which help remove the pathogenic substances from the body and present their antigens to the T cells . The cytokines as well as chemokines produced by the macrophages help in destroying the pathogens , adjusting the immune system and maintaining tissue homoeostasis [ 46 ] . However , in MERS , the virus - infected macrophages contribute considerably to the development of disease symptoms [ 47 ] . The infection with MERS - CoV of human epithelial cells induce the release of pro - inflammatory chemokines and cytokines from the monocyte - derived macrophages . It is believed that these chemokines / cytokines cause inflammatory changes and tissue injury through infiltration of immune cells in the lower respiratory tract [ 47 ] . The patients suffering from MERS clinically manifest pneumonia , which is progressive in nature and has a large number of macrophages and neutrophils found in the fluids present in the lungs [ 3 , 48 ] . Studies conducted on rhesus macaques have shown the lung tissue infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils on MERS - CoV infection , though their respiratory symptoms were milder as compared with humans [ 49 ] . Many scientists believe that this sequestration of immune cells contribute to the development of lymphopenia seen in patients with MERS . The progress in the severity of pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction in the MERS patients is also attributed to cytokine / chemokine induction [ 30 , 50 ] . Zhou et al . found that MERS - CoV can efficiently replicate inside macrophages and , hence , can overcome the host immune system . [ 47 ] . Thus , these phagocytes act like reservoirs and means of transportation for these viruses , helping to replicate and disseminate , such as the HIV virus [ 51 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1188, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1475, "end": 1494}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1792, "end": 1802}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1813, "end": 1824}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
