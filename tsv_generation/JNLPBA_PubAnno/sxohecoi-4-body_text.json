However , in vitro , only a very small amount of virus , usually less than 0 . 3 % of a cell - free virus inoculum , finds its way through cells into the medium bathing basolateral surfaces ( [ 9 ] ) . Interactions between HIV - 1 Env and several host cell surface molecules , including glycolipids , heparan sulfate proteoglycans and gp340 , have been proposed to play a role in transcytosis [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 414}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 520}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
