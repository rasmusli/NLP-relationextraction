We employ time series models that include covariates , such as patient visit counts and ambient temperature , as well as random seasonal terms . We use chest - radiograph ordering data from emergency departments of five regional Midwest children ' s hospitals to detect signatures of respiratory outbreaks . We include visit counts series as a covariate in the chest radiograph model to account for variations due to , for example , ED sizes , changes of staff within the ED , and even some seasonalities across the time period of interest . We use the temperature series as a surrogate measure of the influenza season - the colder months in the western hemisphere . This is a more accurate measure of the influenza season than using a fixed covariate such as a sinusoid . To reflect uncertainty in the variation of the influenza background over seasons , these models allow for randomness in the seasonal components . The use of random seasonal components is an advantage over traditional fixed effect models , since temporal patterns are not assumed to repeat precisely the same way . Thus , signature detection capabilities are improved for the majority of EDs - sensitivity is higher . For increased accuracy and timeliness , the use of our model for the data analysis should represent one component of an integrated detection system . Once a signal is triggered by any of our models , we recommend the use of clinical follow - up to corroborate or refute the emergence of a bona fide epidemic . For example , radiographs and medical charts will need to be reviewed to identify highly anomalous findings or groupings of aberrant findings that would be expected to be present at early stages of outbreaks . We believe that the approach utilized in this work will aid in this process and is more appropriate than models using fixed periodicities that do not have the ability to capture the underlying variabilities across seasons .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
