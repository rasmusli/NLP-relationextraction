These fall on the same mutation - count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 extinction . However , these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic ( the porcine lineage had no extinction event , and hence no pause in mutation accumulation ) . Nearest neighbor calculations ( data not shown ) indicate these strains are not a continuation of the human lineage . They cluster tightly with the 2009 - 2010 outbreak porcine viruses , all of which are more closely related to the 1918 isolate than they are to the human lineage viruses . Thus , we included the 2009 - 2010 viruses and the nine isolated , nonoutbreak viruses in the \" porcine \" category . In this same figure , we can see that genotypes from the 2009 outbreak and after ( Figure 2 , circle ) fall directly on the trajectory of the non - frozen lineage . This clearly shows that the 2009 genotype was not derived from the 1976 re - introduction virus . Kedwaii , et al . [ 8 ] affirmed earlier conclusions that the 2009 genotype was due to a reassortment between two swine viruses , an H1N2 and an H1N1 , from different continents , but this did not affect the mutation accumulation curve . Regardless , general attenuation due to genome - wide mutation accumulation might best explain the very low mortality [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] associated with the 2009 pandemic . The earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1 , 889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
