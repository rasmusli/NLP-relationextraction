( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , e . g . the pathogen generation rate of the index patient . In the actual outbreak case , the values of these parameters may be different from the average values because of the individual differences of the index patients . These differences may significantly increase the uncertainty of the risk assessment results . So the likelihood analysis was performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and assess which human movement pattern assumption was most likely to be the actual case [ 49 ] . During the estimation of likelihood , the uncertainties of the unknown parameters were all considered in the quanta generation rate . The quanta generation rate was the generation rate of the infective pathogens , which can be regarded as the multiple of the infectivity factor to the pathogen generation rate ( rN c f s , hr \u2212 1 ) , as described in Sze To & Chao [ 36 ] . While the risk assessment provided quantitative information on how did human movement affect the infection risks of the passengers , the likelihood analysis served as a better tool to estimate the unknown information in the actual outbreak case .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 882, "end": 901}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
