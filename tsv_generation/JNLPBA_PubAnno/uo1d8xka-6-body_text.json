As a proof of concept , results for an actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of neuraminidase ( NA ) genes of H5N1 isolates and influenza viruses are presented . Various phylogenetic algorithms ; i . e . UPGMA , Neighbor - Joining , Maximum Parsimony , Maximum Likelihood and Mr . Bayes [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] , are compared with respect to their efficiency and accuracy in deriving biologically meaningful results . In particular , the presented study illustrates how these algorithms can be integrated in a unique user - friendly workflow in order to enhance the efficiency of a comparative phyloinformatic analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 246}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
