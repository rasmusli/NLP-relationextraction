To determine whether similar effects of G2 / M - phase synchronization are observed for the currently circulating strains of EV - D68 , cells were treated with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h , and were then infected at 0 . 8 MOI for 2 h and treated with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or fresh medium for another 24 h . Our results demonstrate that nocodazole treatment decreased the genomic RNA levels ( Figure 6A ) and the TCID50 / ml value ( Figure 6B ) of Fermon , US / KY / 14 - 18953 and US / MO / 14 - 18947 , which suggests that the virus inhibition upon G2 / M synchronization may be similar for all enteroviruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 574, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
