In 2014 , FPL re - emerged in eastern Australia , and subsequent outbreaks occurred between 2015 and 2018 in several locations in this region . Similarly , outbreaks of FPL occurred in New Zealand ( NZ ) between 2016 and 2018 , as well as in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) in 2017 , with no outbreaks of FPL reported in either country in recent decades , likely due to the widespread use of FPL vaccines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
