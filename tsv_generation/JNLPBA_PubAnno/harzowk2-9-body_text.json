{"cord_uid": "harzowk2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3488377", "divid": "9", "text": "Evidenced - based guidelines for management of infants and children with community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) were prepared by an expert panel comprising clinicians and investigators representing community pediatrics , public health , and the pediatric specialties of critical care , emergency medicine , hospital medicine , infectious diseases , pulmonology , and surgery [ 5 ] . Amoxicillin should be used as first - line therapy for previously healthy , appropriately immunized infants and preschool - aged children with mild to moderate CAP suspected to be of bacterial origin . Amoxicillin provides appropriate coverage for S . pneumoniae , the most prominent invasive bacterial pathogen . Macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed for treatment of children ( primarily school - aged children and adolescents ) evaluated in an outpatient setting with findings compatible with CAP caused by atypical pathogens . Laboratory testing for M . pneumoniae should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame . Ampicillin or penicillin G should be administered to the fully immunized infant or school - aged child admitted to a hospital ward with CAP when local epidemiologic data document lack of substantial high - level penicillin resistance for invasive S . pneumoniae . Empiric therapy with a third - generation parenteral cephalosporin ( ceftriaxone or cefotaxime ) should be prescribed for hospitalized infants and children who are not fully immunized , in regions where local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal strains documents high - level penicillin resistance , or for infants and children with life - threatening infection , including empyema . Empiric combination therapy with a macrolide ( oral or parenteral ) , in addition to a beta - lactam antibiotic , should be prescribed for the hospitalized child for whom M . pneumonia and C . pneumoniae are significant considerations ; diagnostic testing should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame . Accordingly , earlier initiation of antibiotics might have increased the chances of survival in this child .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
