For seasonal influenza , however , paediatric influenza vaccination was and is currently recommended only for specific risk groups with underlying chronic conditions [ 33 ] . Vaccination uptake was low , even in this target group . Pre - pandemic vaccination rates were 5 % for all children and about 15 % for children with chronic underlying conditions in 2007 / 2008 [ 34 ] . For the pandemic and post - pandemic seasons , no data on vaccination rates is available for children , but vaccination rates as low as 14 % ( 2009 / 10 ) and 11 % ( 2010 / 11 ) were reported for adults , with a vaccination rate of only 17 % even for risk group adults [ 35 ] . In our study , more than 75 % of influenzaassociated PICU patients were children with underlying chronic conditions . Analysis of their reported influenza [ 20 ] ) . Data are given in % , by age group and season . Season 1 : Oct10 - Sep11 ( n = 18 ) , Season 3 : Oct12 - Sep13 ( n = 13 ) ; Season 2 : Oct11 - Sep12 ( n = 1 ) is not shown vaccination status showed that among these were a high proportion of vaccine - eligible but unvaccinated children . Patients with chronic conditions too young to be vaccinated and other paediatric risk groups , such as otherwise healthy children below 2 years of age , are not covered by the current German recommendation . All these groups could profit considerably from universal influenza vaccination for children , either directly or by herd protection . In contrast to the situation in Germany , in the United States universal influenza vaccination for all children older than 6 months of age has been established , and vaccination coverage reached a level of approximately 41 % in 2013 [ 36 ] . Compared to 348 influenza - associated paediatric deaths observed in the United States during the pandemic 2009 / 10 , only 79 were observed in the strong A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 season 2013 / 14 [ 37 ] . This might partly be explained by increasing immunity in children after previous A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 infection , but may in part also be a result of the influenza vaccination program [ 37 ] . In England , a universal childhood vaccination programme with a new live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) with intra - nasal application was started in the 2013 / 14 influenza season [ 38 ] . First results showed an overall uptake of 53 % in primary school aged children , indicating a good acceptance of LAIV , and suggesting direct and indirect impacts on disease incidence , including reduction of paediatric influenza - associated hospitalisations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
