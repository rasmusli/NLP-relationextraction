Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non - overlapping groups ; for a definition we refer to [ 19 ] . For any given partition , modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low . For large networks , a variety of methods have been introduced to approximate their optimal subdivision . The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition . For further details we refer to [ 18 , 20 ] and in Text S1 we describe how we incorporate subdivision uncertainty in our phylogeographic approach .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
