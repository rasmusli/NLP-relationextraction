While the amount of data available to modellers is increasing , so too are privacy concerns . In order to predict the risk of disease spread in humans across large spatial scales , detailed movement networks must be established . These networks can be informed using commuting and migration data available from population censuses [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] . These data capture long - term trends , but may not be appropriate at predicting movements over a shorter time scale , and therefore can be complemented by the inclusion of other information such as mobile phone data . Mobile phone records track locations and times that individuals make and receive calls , and therefore can act as a proxy for shorter - scale movement patterns [ 23 , 26 ] . While full access to these datasets is not readily available , previous work indicates that partial samples may be sufficient to accurately predict the risk associated with disease spread across these networks [ 24 , 27 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
