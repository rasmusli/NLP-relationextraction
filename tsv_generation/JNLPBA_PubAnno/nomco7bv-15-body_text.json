For pneumonia , only obese subjects had a higher prevalence . The overweight group was typically falling in between the groups with normal weight and obesity ( Table 3 ) . The strongest association was seen for pneumonia and bronchitis , and accordingly , any LRTI was more strongly associated with obesity than any URTI . Long - lasting RTIs , frequent RTIs and high diary scores were also more strongly associated with obesity than the individual symptoms . Adjustments by age and education did only marginally change these estimates . Among subjects with an infection , long lasting infections were again associated with obesity , reaching significance for any RTI , rhinitis , pharyngitis / laryngitis , influenza - like illness , and bronchitis ( Table 3 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
