HAdV was frequently ( 76 / 552 , 13 . 77 % ) detected , and HAdV - B and HAdV - C were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China , respectively . However , we only amplified relatively conserved partial hexon sequences rather than the hypervariable region ( HVR ) , perhaps resulting in the loss of the recombinant and variant information . More extensive studies will be needed to address the prevalence and geographic distribution of dominant genotypes of HAdV using well - matched control groups and sequential samples collected over a longer time . Finally , to the best of our knowledge , HAdV - 37 ( KM378014 ) and HAdV - 57 ( KM377992 ) are the first strains of these genotypes to be reported in inpatient children with SARI .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 406}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
