The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community ( EPIC ) study identified viruses as the most commonly identified etiologic agent in children and adults hospitalized with pneumonia . An etiologic agent was detected in 81 % of 2222 children < 18 years of age : 66 % had one or more viral pathogens , 8 % one or more bacterial pathogens and 7 % both bacterial and viral pathogens [ 5 ] . Among 2259 adults , an etiologic agent was detected in 38 % : 23 % had one or more viral pathogens , 11 % one or more bacterial pathogens and 3 % both bacterial and viral pathogens [ 6 ] . However , virtually all these serious pneumonia cases were treated with antibiotics , as secondary bacterial infection can complicate lower respiratory viral infection . Therefore , even in cases determined to be pneumonia solely of viral etiology , bacterial interactions of virus and bacteria may play some role .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
