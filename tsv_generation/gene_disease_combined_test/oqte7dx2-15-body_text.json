Dahlberg and Juo ( 2014 ) showed that the C . elegans homologs of WDR48 and WDR20 form a stable ternary complex with USP - 46 in HEK293T cells . Consistent with prior studies ( Cohn et al . , 2009 ; Kee et al . , 2010 ; Faesen et al . , 2011 ) , full activation of C . elegans USP - 46 catalytic activity in vitro requires both WDR48 and WDR20 ( Dahlberg and Juo , 2014 ) . In contrast to the increased degradation of GLR - 1 observed in usp - 46 loss - of - function mutants ( Kowalski et al . , 2011 ) , overexpression of usp - 46 in neurons does not stabilize GLR - 1 ( Dahlberg and Juo , 2014 ) . However , co - expression of WDR - 48 and WDR - 20 in neurons did increase surface and total levels of GLR - 1 as well as glutamate - dependent behavior in an usp - 46 - dependent manner . These data suggest that endogenous WDR - 48 and WDR - 20 may be limiting in vivo . Together with data showing that co - expression of the USP - 46 / WDR - 48 / WDR - 20 complex reduces levels of ubiquitinated GLR - 1 ( Dahlberg and Juo , 2014 ) , these results support a model wherein USP - 46 , when bound to WDR - 48 and WDR - 20 , deubiquitinates GLR - 1 and increases receptor stability and function in vivo .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 121}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
