The identification of putative LIR motifs has been done for all the reviewed sequences for viral proteins . Among the sequences sorted as putative LIR - containing proteins , 1517 sequences belong to 188 species of bacteriophages ( Table S2 ) . However , it is likely that these sequences correspond to false - positive hits as bacteria don ' t have an autophagy process . Using a hypergeometric test ( see supplementary information ) , we compared the enrichment fold of proteins containing LIR motifs ( LIRCPs ) in bacteriophages with viruses infecting eukaryotes . We noticed that the enrichment fold for both xLIR and WxxL patterns in LIRCPs was higher in viruses infecting eukaryotes than in bacteriophages ( Table S2 ) which is in line with the fact that autophagy has been reported only in eukaryotes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 163}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
