Note that G may contain no base pairs . Iterative HFold also uses the SimFold RNA secondary structure prediction method [ 63 ] , which predicts the minimum free energy pseudoknot - free secondary structure for a given RNA sequence . SimFold uses a dynamic programming method similar to Zuker ' s MFold method [ 64 ] . In this work we used the HotKnots energy parameters when running SimFold . In addition to an RNA sequence , S , SimFold can also take a pseudoknot - free secondary structure , G , as input and predict the MFE pseudoknotfree secondary structure that contains all base pairs of G .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
