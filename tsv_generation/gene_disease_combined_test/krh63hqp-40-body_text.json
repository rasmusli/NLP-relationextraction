We feel that the 15 % divergence must be primarily non - adaptive because adaptation should occur rapidly and then reach a natural optimum . Yet , we see that divergence increases in a remarkably linear manner . Furthermore , the virus does not seem to be converging on a new optimal genotype since polymorphism remains extreme ( over 50 % ) , since many polymorphic sites have more than two alleles , and since codon specificity is declining over time . Codon patterns can inform us about the origin of the virus , and they tell us that H1N1 is not only drifting away from that original codon use , but it is also drifting away from the host codon preferences . When grown in mouse cell culture , 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited variation in replication rates , virulence , and pathogenicity , but these did not match the severity of clinical symptoms in humans [ 66 ] . Thus , at this time , the exact relationship between mutation load and the severity of infection remains unknown . Yet , selective adaptation is limited to only those amino acids that produce significant phenotypic effects [ 42 ] , and , since a viral genome in the absence of reassortment is essentially a single linkage block , it is expected that many more than just adaptive mutations occur . Some of the changes might be due to selection , but the majority certainly are not .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 471}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
