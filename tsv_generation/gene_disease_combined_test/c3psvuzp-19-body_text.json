In contrast , selection to increase the breadth of antiviral specificities could also lead to increase in gene copy number [ 34 ] . As a result of these repeated rounds of innovations , many organisms undergo dramatic changes in their antiviral gene repertoires over evolutionary timeframes , as has been observed with APOBEC and TRIM genes in mammals [ 38 , 39 ] . In our initial evolutionary screen , we had observed that most of PARP15 is missing from the whitecheeked gibbon genome . Coupled with previous findings of PARP15 absence in the mouse genome [ 10 ] , we therefore investigated PARP genes in general , with an emphasis on the macro - PARP genes , for signatures of rapid gene turnover .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 29}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
