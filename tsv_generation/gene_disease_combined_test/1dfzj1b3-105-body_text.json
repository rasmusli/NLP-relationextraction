Origanum syriacum L . predominatly composed by carvacrol and thymol did not show such ability [ 139 ] . However , more examples of NO inhibition can be reported , for example the production of NO was also inhibited by the citrus peel waste essential oil in LPS - activated RAW 264 . 7 macrophages [ 140 ] , or the oil of Distichoselinum tenuifolium ( Lag . ) Garcia Martin & Silvestre , mainly composed by myrcene , that significantly inhibited NO production stimulated by LPS in macrophages , demonstrating , therefore , in vitro anti - inflammatory properties [ 141 ] . PGE 2 was only inhibited by LPS - stimulated macrophages J774 . A1 cells when treated with high concentrations of ( - ) - linalool . The same was observed for the COX - 2 expression . The same monoterpene inhibited NO release but did not inhibit the increase of iNOS expression indicating that the inhibitory activity of linalool was mainly attributed to the iNOS enzyme activity [ 142 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 768}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
