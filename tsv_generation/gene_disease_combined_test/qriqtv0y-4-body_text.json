We tested 307 rectal swab samples for CaKoV by using one - step RT - PCR specific to 3D gene . Based on a two - year survey , we found CaKoV positivity at 17 . 59 % ( 54 / 307 ) . CaKoVs could be detected in both sick ( 19 . 44 % ( 49 / 252 ) ) and healthy ( 9 . 09 % ( 5 / 55 ) ) animals . Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in dogs ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . In relation to age group , CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 25 . 45 % ( 42 / 165 ) ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . The coinfections of CaKoV with other enteric viral pathogens were observed including CaKoV / Canine parvovirus / Canine Coronavirus ( n = 6 ) , CaKoV / Canine parvovirus ( n = 20 ) and CaKoV / Canine Coronavirus ( n = 2 ) . In this study , 12 CaKoVs were selected and characterized by whole genome sequencing ( n = 4 ) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing ( n = 8 ) . The viruses were selected to represent epidemiological and demographic data such as age , date of isolation and breed . In this study , nucleotide sequences of the CaKoV were submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers MK201776 - MK201795 ( Table 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
