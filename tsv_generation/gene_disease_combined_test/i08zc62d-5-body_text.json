Flavonoids , which are polyphenolic compounds , are widespread in the plant kingdom and are known to show antibacterial and antiviral effects ( Liu et al . , 2008 ; Jeong et al . , 2009 ; Grienke et al . , 2012 ) . Natural flavonoids have also been reported to have latent anti - influenza and antibacterial effects against SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) virus , MRSA ( methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) and Chagas disease mediated by a trypanosome ( Arioka et al . , 2010 ; Cho et al . , 2013 ; Navr\u00e1 tilov\u00e1 et al . , 2013 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
