We reasoned that evolutionary signatures of recurrent adaptation , such as those previously observed in PARP13 , might reveal other uncharacterized PARP proteins that are involved in host - virus interactions . We therefore screened all 17 human PARP genes and their primate orthologs for signatures of recurrent positive selection . Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in ' housekeeping ' functions , we found that nearly one third of human PARP genes bore signatures of recurrent genetic conflicts . In addition to PARP13 , our evolutionary screen revealed four other PARP genes that have evolved under very strong positive selection in primates : PARP4 , 9 , 14 and 15 . Two of these genes ( PARP14 and 15 ) have also undergone dramatic gene turnover ( gain and loss ) during vertebrate evolution , an additional hallmark of gene innovation also seen in innate immunity genes such as APOBEC3 and TRIM5 [ 38 , 39 ] . Based on their rapid evolution , we hypothesize that these four additional PARP genes are involved in as - yetundescribed host - virus conflicts . Importantly , we anticipate that the identification of these rapidly evolving PARP genes and domains will enable future experiments to elucidate the role ADPribosylation plays in viral replication and host immunity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 204}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
