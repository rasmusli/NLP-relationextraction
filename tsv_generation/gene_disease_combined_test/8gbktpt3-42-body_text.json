CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are usually below the limit of detection of antigen tests , ranging from 1 . 48 \u00d7 10 0 to 2 . 5 \u00d7 10 4 copies / mg of faeces in one study [ 24 ] and from \u2248 10 0 to 7 . 50 \u00d7 10 5 copies / mg of faeces in another [ 31 ] . The lower limit of detection of faecal antigen tests for CPV in dogs is 10 5 to 10 6 viral DNA copies per mg of faeces [ 32 ] . Low titres of gut FPV antibodies in the New Zealand cats could explain the positive faecal antigen test results in those cats with low faecal viral loads .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 159}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
