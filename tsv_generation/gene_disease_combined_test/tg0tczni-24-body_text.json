Specifically , after accounting for dinucleotide biases , the proportion of codon usage bias explained by mutation pressure often increases , as seen in human RNA viruses [ 25 ] . Our study revealed that CpG and the eight CpG - containing codons are notably deficient in ORFs of 48 poliovirus genomes . The explanation for the CpG deficiency is immunologic escape . A high CpG content may be detrimental to small DNA ( or RNA ) viruses , as unmethylated CpGs are recognized by the host ' s innate immune system ( Toll - like receptor 9 ) as a pathogen signature [ 32 ] . As with vertebrate genomes , methylated viral genomes would face a high chance of mutation at CpGs , that would result in a reduction of this dinucleotide [ 9 , 33 ] . We found that DVPVs and live attenuated virus of genotype 1 have lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide compare with wild viruses of polioviruses genotype 1 . The most popular explanation for lower frequencies of CpG in ORFs of DVPV genomes is that when OPV viruses turning into VDPV genotype 1 , a lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide maybe help VDPV out of the host immunity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 379}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
