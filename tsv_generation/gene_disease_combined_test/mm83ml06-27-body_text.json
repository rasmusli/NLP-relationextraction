To address this issue , HeLa cells were co - transfected with HA - tagged ubiquitin ( HA - Ub ) and syngag expression plasmids , and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs . The [UNK] PTAP mutant , which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag , was assessed in parallel [ 25 , 30 ] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment , cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG - 132 and Lactacystin ( LC ) 4 h prior to cell lysis . After immunoprecipitation with Gag - specific antibodies , western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti - HA staining ( Figure 8 ) . Following co - expression of syngag wt and HA - Ub , a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed , which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag . Upon treatment with 14 \u03bcM PR - 619 or 20 \u03bcM P22077 , the intensity of the HA - Ub - signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination - levels of the [UNK] PTAP mutant . Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti - CA staining . Thus , treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag . In our previous studies , we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag - derived epitopes on MHC - I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [ 26 , 32 , 48 , 67 ] . To investigate whether DI treatment leads to enhanced antigen presentation , we measured the presentation of Gag - derived epitopes on MHC - I molecules at the cell surface as described previously [ 26 , 32 , 33 , 48 ] . After transfection of the syngag - SL expression plasmid into He cells , which stably express the murine MHC - I allotype H2 - K b ( referred to as HeLa - K b cells ) [ 68 ] , flow cytometry analyses revealed a concentration - dependent increase in SL presentation after treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 ( Figure 9A ) . Addition of 10 \u03bcM P22077 or 7 \u03bcM PR - 619 led to a 3 - fold increase in SL presentation , while addition of 14 \u03bcM PR - 619 caused an even 10 - fold increase in the SL presentation . To exclude that the enhanced antigen presentation was due to elevated levels of H2 - K b complexes at the cell surface resulting from DI treatment , the amount of total H2 - K b was quantified , showing similar amounts of H2 - K b molecules at the cell surface after treatment with P22077 and PR - 619 compared to untreated control ( Figure 9B ) .

Taken together , these results indicate that DIs , especially those targeting USP7 and USP47 , not only inhibit HIV - 1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus entry of Gag into the MHC - I pathway .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
