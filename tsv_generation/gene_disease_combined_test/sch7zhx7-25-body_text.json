As shown in Figure 2A , the wildtype and mutant viruses replicate with similar kinetics . To ascertain whether these viruses produced similar levels of infectious particles , we measured the ratio of viral genomes to infectious virus . Vero cells were infected with the wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h , and subsequently , viral titers ( Figure 3A ) were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant . The number of viral genomes was quantified by qRT - PCR ( Figure 3B ) , and the ratio of genomes to infectious virus ( pfu ) calculated ( Figure 3C ) . We observed no changes in viral titers in polyamine - sufficient conditions , and viral genomes were slightly elevated , though not statistically significant , in 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutant viruses ( Figure 3B ) . Overall , the genome - to - pfu ratio was not statistically significantly different among our protease mutant viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 373}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
