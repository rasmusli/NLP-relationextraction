Our data show the full - length core and NS3 ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) proteins have the major immunodominant epitopes of the HCV genome . More importantly , our study verify that the full - length core and NS3 ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) recombinant antigen can be used to construct a double antigen sandwich lateral - flow immunochromatographic anti - HCV immunoassay strip . This strip allows for the more rapid and more economical detection of HCV . It also has a high sensitivity and specificity in testing for HCV . It has the potential to become a useful tool for HCV clinical detection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
