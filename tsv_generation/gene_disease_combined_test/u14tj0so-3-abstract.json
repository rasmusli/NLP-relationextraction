Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot - free structure , and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any ( density - 2 ) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure . Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods , namely the fast running time of HFold , a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis , and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2 . 0 . Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information , with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54 % to 79 % as the user provides up to 40 % of the input structure . Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2 . 0 , while having comparable accuracy . Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK - PK and IP - pk168 data sets .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 520, "end": 529}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
