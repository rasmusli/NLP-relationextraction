The HCV structural proteins ( core , E1 , and E2 proteins ) in the rVV - CN construct may cause the difference ; Saito et al . reported that injection with plasmid constructs encoding the core protein induced a specific CTL response in BALB / c mice [ 24 ] . Reportedly , CTL activity against core or envelope protein is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins , but core - specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV core [ 21 ] . In contrast , when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the HCV polyprotein were injected into BALB / c mice , only the HCV core protein markedly suppressed vaccinia - specific CTL responses [ 25 ] . Thus , the HCV core protein may have an immunomodulatory function [ 26 ] . Based on these reports and our results , we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV - N25 treatment were as follows : 1 ) this rVV construct included the core and envelope proteins and 2 ) the core protein had an immune - suppressive effect on CTL induction . Therefore , we suggest that exclusion of the core and envelope antigen as immunogen is one important factor in HCV vaccine design .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
