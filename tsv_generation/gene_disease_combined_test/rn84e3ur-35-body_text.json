Figure 7 gives a thirty - second time profile of the relative intake dose of the moving person for moving speeds of 0 . 5 m / s and 1 . 0 m / s ( case 2 and 3 ) . As shown in Figure 7 , the relative intake dose of the moving person increases quickly after the person starts to move ( t \u2265 1 s ) . The peak value appears at t = 5 s and t = 3 s for case 2 and 3 , corresponding to a moving distance of 2 m , where the moving person is quite close to the index patient . Figure 7 also indicates a high relative intake dose during the movement ( t = 2 . 5 ~ 7 s for 0 . 5 m / s and t = 25 s for 1 . 0 m / s ) , when the moving person walks through the region with high aerosol concentration ( row 6 - 11 ) . So a passenger or a crew member will receive a high intake dose if he / she walks through the aisle when the index patient is coughing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
