In addition , there was a very consistent loss of codon specificity over time ( Figures 6 and 7 ) . We show compelling new evidence supporting the extinction of human H1N1 in the 1950s , its subsequent re - introduction in 1976 , and an apparent second extinction event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009 . Strain extinction has often occurred when new strains appeared , including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3 - like strains in 1917 , H2N2 replacing H1N1 in 1957 , and H3N2 replacing H2N2 in 1968 [ 5 ] . To our knowledge , we are the first to document the replacement of the re - introduced human H1N1 with reassorted swine H1N1 in 2009 . All this is consistent with the genetic attenuation hypothesis , and we feel this is the most fundamental explanation for the very smooth , systematic , and exponential decline in H1N1 mortality rates since 1918 [ 2 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 539}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
