For instance , it could be shown that Ub - ligases as well as the 26S proteasome play an important role in various steps of virus replication , e . g . , entry , maturation and latent virus reactivation [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] . Regarding the role of DUBs in HIV - 1 replication , it has been shown that the ESCRT - III interacting DUB AMSH ( associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM ) can inhibit viral particle production , while AMSH knockdown did not influence virus release [ 79 ] . Interestingly , AMSH has been reported to bind to the ESCRT - III component CHMP3 upon coexpression , which then acts as inhibitor of HIV - 1 release [ 80 ] . Recently , selective DIs have become available and facilitate the investigation of the role of DUBs in viral replication . Some of these DIs allow selective targeting of just one of the 90 known DUBs which might be one explanation for their relatively low toxicity [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] . However , an antiretroviral activity of DIs has been reported herein for the first time .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
