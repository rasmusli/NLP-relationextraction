Four of these children suffered both from severe neurological conditions ( two children with previous peripartal asphyxia and spastic tetraparesis ; one child with cerebral paresis and tetraspasticity ; one child with congenital cerebral disorder ) , and from chronic pulmonary conditions ; two of these four children were also born pre - term . Influenza - associated pneumonia was diagnosed in all four of these children ; three additionally had secondary bacterial pneumonia , and one child also developed sepsis . For the fifth child , obesity was reported as the only risk factor ; and sepsis and suspected encephalitis as complications . Bacterial co - pathogens were detected in three of these five children and suspected in one child ; two viral and two fungal co - infections were also reported . All five children received intratracheal ventilation , antibiotics and catecholamines ; two were additionally treated with antiviral medication . Death occurred 1 , 2 , 4 , 19 , and 26 days after PICU admission , with ARDS reported as cause of death in three children . Sequelae were reported for five patients ( 10 . 6 % ) : state after surgery due to pleural effusion / empyema in two children ; increased oxygen requirements in two children who had previously already received oxygen therapy at home ; damage of the lung after high - pressure ventilation in one child . Table 2 ) . Figure 1 shows the difference in age distribution between both seasons , and the high proportion of children below 2 years of age as opposed to low proportions in all other age groups in season 3 . After onset of symptoms , children were admitted to a PICU after a significantly shorter period , with a median of 3 days ( IQR 1 - 4 ) in season 1 compared to 6 days ( IQR 2 . 0 - 7 . 5 ) in season 3 ( Table 2 ) . In season 1 , significantly fewer children were diagnosed with bronchitis / bronchiolitis ( Table 4 ) , and they tended to require CPAP treatment less frequently than in season 3 ( 11 . 1 % vs . 41 . 7 % , p = 0 . 084 , Table 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
