Before its apparent extinction in 2009 , the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations ( mostly point mutations ) , including 320 non - synonymous mutations , compared to the 1918 genotype . Across all 3 , 755 H1N1 genomes isolated from humans ( i . e . , including the outbreak and non - outbreak porcine versions ) , we found that only 41 . 8 % of all nucleotide sites were invariant . Multiple variant forms ( i . e . , 3 - fold and 4 - fold degeneracy , meaning 3 and sometimes 4 different nucleotides observed at a given site ) occurred at 21 % of the variable loci , further suggesting that the mutations were primarily non - adaptive . When we included the porcine H1N1 genotypes , only 36 . 1 % of sites remained invariant , with a similar distribution of nucleotide degeneracy . Because the re - introduced H1N1 lineage had accumulated fewer mutations than the porcine H1N1 strains , the disappearance of the human lineage and the subsequent dominance of the 2009 porcine strain in the human population resulted in even more divergence from the 1918 stain : over 1900 nucleotide differences ( approximately 15 % divergence ) and 325 amino acids differences ( approximately 7 % divergence in protein sequence ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
