Some fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) studies described the critical role of the association between CD81 and CLDN1 coreceptors in HCV entry [ 104 , 105 ] . Next , a rate - limiting role for SR - BI in HCV infection has been reported [ 106 ] . The in vitro study demonstrated that increased SR - BI expression would enhance entry and internalization of HCV . Several studies investigating the postbinding cellular mechanisms found that the ability of HCV penetration into the hepatocytes may depend on clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 107 , 108 ] . After internalization , fusion occurs between viral and endosomal membranes . Recent assay further showed that the fusion may be low of pH and temperature dependent and facilitated by cholesterol [ 109 , 110 ] . Although the detailed molecular mechanism of HCV entry still needs more investigations , it is conceivable that HCV internalization and fusion may offer many targets for the development of HCV entry inhibitors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
