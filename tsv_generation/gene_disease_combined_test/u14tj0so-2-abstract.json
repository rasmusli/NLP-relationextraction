Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict . Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy ; however , there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input . There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
