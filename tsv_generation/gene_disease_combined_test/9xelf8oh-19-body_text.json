Some squirrels were suspected to have SQPVor SADV based on gross lesions ( skin ulcers or enteritis , respectively ) , while three red squirrels had no sign of disease ( i . e . road casualties ) and three red squirrels were selected on the basis that they had gross lesions not traditionally associated with either SQPV or SADV ( skin or gastrointestinal inflammation , respectively ) . As grey squirrels rarely show clinical signs for either infection , 16 carcases were selected at random from samples submitted as part of a grey squirrel control programme ( during autumn 2011 ) . All squirrels had a systematic necropsy examination . Swabs ( Dacron tip , Fisher Scientific UK Ltd . , Loughborough , UK ) were taken from sites believed to have a predilection for SQPV infection ( i . e . oral / lip , eyelid and / or arm vibrissae ) ( Atkin et al . 2010 ) or SADV enteric infection ( rectum ) . Corresponding skin samples were taken , along with flank and chest ( vibrissae ) skin samples for grey squirrels and nose , ear , digit , inguinal and genital skin samples for red squirrels . Submandibular lymph node , lung , heart , liver , kidney , spleen , stomach , small intestine ( duodenum and jejunum ) , large intestine ( caecum and colon ) , faeces , skeletal muscle and brain were all sampled . Blood was collected postmortem and serum was separated from the cell pellet by centrifugation ( 13 , 000 rpm for 10 min ) . All samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0 C until DNA purification using a DNeasy \u00ae blood and tissue kit ( Qiagen , Manchester , UK ) and the manufacturer ' s protocol . DNA was extracted from swabs using protocol ( a ) in the Online Resource S5 . DNA was isolated from the blood cell pellet using a FlexiGene DNA kit ( Qiagen , Manchester , UK ) following the protocol ( b ) in the Online Resource S5 . A ' no sample ' DNA extraction was completed in tandem with every batch of extractions to monitor potential contamination during DNA extractions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
