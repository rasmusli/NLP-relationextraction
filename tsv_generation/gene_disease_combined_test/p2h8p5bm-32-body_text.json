In TBFV infection , viperin was shown to control LGTV dissemination and replication in the brain after intraperitoneal administration , and viperin promoted survival after intracranial infection [ 141 ] . Interestingly , viperin has been shown to be expressed in the brain at the basal state [ 128 ] , with high basal expression in primary astrocytes [ 100 , 141 ] . Viperin ' s role within the brain during neurotropic LGTV infection was further mapped to certain brain regions , as viperin inhibited viral replication in the olfactory bulb and cerebrum , but not in the cerebellum or brainstem . This correlates very well with TBEV infection since viperin strongly inhibited TBEV replication in primary neurons and astrocytes from the cerebrum , but not in granular cell neurons isolated from the cerebellum . Interestingly , cortical neurons were completely dependent on viperin for IFN - mediated inhibition of TBEV , whereas in astrocytes , in which the IFN - mediated antiviral activities are strongly dependent on viperin , other ISGs could partly compensate for loss of viperin [ 141 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
