If reporting is done improperly and in haste , consequences include the destruction of roosting sites or culling bat populations , which can undermine conservation efforts and can break down trust among network participants . Similarly , accurate and timely reporting of virus surveillance in bats should be coupled with scientifically - informed intervention recommendations to reduce bat - human interactions ( e . g . , placing bamboo skirts over date palm sap collection pots curtailed the spread of Nipah virus in Bangladesh [ 153 ] ) . Successfully blending both conservation and public health messaging is difficult , but critical to preventing spillover into human populations and the subsequent retaliatory actions against bats [ 10 , 12 , 154 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
