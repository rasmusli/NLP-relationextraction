As a control , mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against GFP . The mosquitoes were infected with WNV ( NY99 strain ) by blood - feeding 24 h post - microinjection . At 10 days post - infection , saliva from individual mosquitoes was collected in a capillary tube ( see methods ) and total RNA was collected from whole mosquito carcass and midgut . As a parallel experiment , mosquitoes were collected at day 2 and day 10 post - infection . Western blot was performed on whole mosquito using anti - CxSTAT and anti - actin antibodies . Results showed increased levels of CxSTAT by day 2 postinfection . The levels decreased to baseline by day 10 post - infection in control mosquitoes ( GFP dsRNA ) ; however in mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA , STAT levels remained high ( Fig 5E ) . Real - time RT - qPCR results showed efficient knock - down ( > 60 % ) of CxCul4 mRNA in carcass after Cul4 dsRNA microinjections ( Fig 6A ) . The results also showed a decrease ( > 50 % ) in viral RNA ( NS1 ) in whole mosquito carcass ( Fig 6B ) and midgut ( Fig 6D ) in CxCul4 dsRNAinjected mosquitoes compared with the control , confirming pro - viral effect of CxCul4 . Interestingly , real - time RT - qPCR results also showed a significant increase in CxVir1 mRNA expression in carcass ( 3 - fold ) ( Fig 6C ) and midgut ( 5 - fold ) ( Fig 6E ) in CxCul4 - knockdown mosquitoes , indicating increased Jak - STAT signaling . Plaque assays performed on mosquito saliva showed a significantly lower virus titer in mosquito saliva microinjected with CxCul4 dsRNA ( 88 pfu / mosquito ) compared with control ( GFP dsRNA ) ( 429 pfu / mosquito ) ( Fig 6F ) , indicating a lower likelihood of virus transmission by CxCul4 silenced mosquitoes . It should be noted that saliva from 3 mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA injection showed higher viral titers ( similar to controls ) . Further analysis showed that CxCul4 was not efficiently knocked down in these three mosquitoes ( Fig 6A , inset ) . These results further validate that CxCul4 has a proviral effect by inhibiting Jak - STAT pathway during WNV infection in mosquitoes . It should also be noted that ~ 20 - 30 % of mosquitoes from each group did not show any virus in the saliva , possibly indicative of vector competence of these mosquito species .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
