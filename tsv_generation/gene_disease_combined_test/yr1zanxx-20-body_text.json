CTRL : Control ; PLX : PLX5622 Funk and Klein Journal of Neuroinflammation ( 2019 ) 16 : 22 As expected , WNV - NS5 - E218A was barely detected in the kidney ( Fig . 3j ) , and the virus was steadily cleared from the serum ( Fig . 3k ) in both control - and PLX5622 - treated mice . However , significantly higher levels of virus were detected in the spleen of PLX5622versus control - treated , WNV - NS5 - E218A - infected mice at 4 dpi ( Fig . 3i ) , which was consistent with data obtained during f . p . infection with WNV - NY . Overall , CSF1R antagonism leads to enhanced mortality and loss of virologic control in both the periphery and CNS regardless of the WNV strain utilized , suggesting a critical role for this molecule in antiviral immunity . Fig . 2 PLX5622 - treated mice exhibit increased mortality , increased encephalitis score , and impaired virologic control compared with control mice following peripheral infection with WNV - NY . a - d Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks , then infected with 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad infection , then monitored for ( a ) mortality , ( b ) weight loss , and ( c , d ) encephalitis score for up to 25 dpi . a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control - treated mice infected with either viral inoculum dose , as calculated by log - rank ( Mantel - Cox ) test . b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness . After death , the last measured weight was carried through to the end of the experiment . Significantly greater weight loss was measured in PLX5622 - treated mice compared with controls infected with 10 2 PFU as calculated by two - way ANOVA with matched values comparing group means without multiple comparisons . c Clinical scores of PLX5622 or control - treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU or d 10 4 PFU as indicated during acute illness . 0 = subclinical , 1 = hunched / ruffled fur , 2 = altered gate / slow movement , 3 = no movement , but responsive to stimuli , 4 = moribund , 5 = dead . e - k Tissue viral loads as measured by plaque assay at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi following infection with 10 2 PFU in control ( black ) or PLX5622 - treated ( red ) mice . l Serum viral loads as measured by qRT - PCR . e - l Data are presented as scatter plots with each mouse represented by a dot with the SEM indicated by a line .
