The autoimmune aspects of KD have recently been reviewed [ 118 ] . Self - antigen responses to a variety of targets have actually been well described in KD . These include recent reports of antibody responses to type III collagen , myosin [ 119 ] , cardiolipin [ 120 ] , alpha - enolase [ 121 ] , and anti - endothelial antibodies . Anti - endothelial antibodies are particularly interesting as these are seen in other disorders , such as SLE and renal allograft rejection [ 122 ] . Other vasculitides have also been associated with anti - endothelial antibodies . These have been shown to cause upregulation of E - selectin , VCAM - 1 , ICAM - 1 and NF\u03baB [ 123 ] . Responses to these antibodies include upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of the endothelial cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
