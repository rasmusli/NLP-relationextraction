In the SEED database , we use IDs that specify proteinencoding genes in a rapidly growing set of genomes , and we support correspondences between these IDs and those used by other annotation efforts . The SEED has two notions of equivalence : ( i ) two IDs that represent either protein - encoding genes or protein sequences are said to be sequence equivalent if the protein sequences are identical and ( ii ) two IDs that represent either exactly the same protein - encoding gene or the precise protein encoded by the gene ( that is , ' ' the protein sequence of gene X in genome Y ' ' ) are said to be precisely equivalent . Unfortunately , in the presence of multiple versions of thousands of genomes , perfect maintenance of the ' ' precisely equivalent ' ' correspondence is virtually impossible .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
