We observed that 45 % and 38 % of the putative LIR motifs matching the WxxL pattern are of F - type and Y - type respectively . W - type motifs are the least represented , with about 17 % of the patterns ( Fig . 2C ) . Similar distribution could be observed for the putative xLIR motifs with a higher variability across families , probably due to the low representation of xLIR motifs compared with WxxL patterns ( Fig . 2D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 15}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
