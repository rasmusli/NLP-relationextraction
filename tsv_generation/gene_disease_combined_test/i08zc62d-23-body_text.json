To overcome drug resistance , various natural flavonoid compounds containing a Structural comparison of Cp - NanI CD , the human Neu2 - Neu5Ac2en complex structure and homology models of human Neu1 , Neu3 and Neu4 . ( a ) Overall superposed structures of Cp - NanI CD ( green ) , the human Neu2 - Neu5Ac2en complex structure ( grey ) and homology models of human Neu1 ( purple ) , Neu3 ( brown ) and Neu4 ( magenta ) .
