Owners were trained to use the feline Fecal Consistency Scale ( FCS ; Figure 1 ) and to respond to the daily IVRS phone call . On days 1 - 28 , owners received daily IVRS phone calls to record the number of vomiting episodes and presence of diarrhea over the 24 - h period . A diary was provided to track daily observations and to record daily FCS scores .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 548}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
