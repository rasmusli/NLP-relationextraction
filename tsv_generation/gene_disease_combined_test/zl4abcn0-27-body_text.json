Callus cultures supplemented with growth regulators at various combinations Comparing the amount of lycorine obtained from both wild plant and the callus tissue culture , it can be noticed that callus culture supplemented with appropriate concentrations and combination of growth regulators resulted in production of comparable amount of lycorine . This may be due to the effect of plant growth regulators ( PGRs ) such as the auxin and cytokinin used herein . PGRs are known to have effects not only on cell differentiation and proliferation but also on the biosynthesis pathway of the cell [ 22 , 23 ] . Therefore , in this study , there may be a probability that the 2 , 4 - D and BAP used in the callus culture could have partly been involved in the biosynthesis of lycorine . From the present study , the callus culture may be supplemented with only 4 . 50 M 2 , 4 - D or a combination of 9 . 00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4 . 5 M BAP to obtain a good yield of lycorine . This study can be further extended to investigate other combinations of PGRs that may increase the lycorine content of the callus culture . The findings of such study would prove to be useful as there are many benefits of the lycorine to the medical and health sector .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
