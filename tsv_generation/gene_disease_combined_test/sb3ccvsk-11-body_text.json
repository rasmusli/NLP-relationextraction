However , their role in regulating endogenously primed T cell populations of viral , and more importantly , SR specificity has not been addressed . To specifically investigate a function of Foxp3 + Tregs during JHMV persistence , we infected DEREG mice , in which DT treatment abrogated the vast majority of Foxp3 + Tregs under homeostatic conditions but retained a minor fraction thereby circumventing lymphoproliferative disease ( 22 ) . We first confirmed that transgene expression in DEREG mice does not alter JHMV pathogenesis compared to syngeneic WT mice . Clinical disease onset and progression , viral clearance , and CNS inflammatory responses were similar between the two groups ( data not shown ) . The extent and severity of demyelination within spinal cords was also not altered ( data not shown ) . Moreover , high fluorescent intensity of eGFP expressed under control of the Foxp3 promoter in DEREG mice enabled a distinct separation of the Foxp3 + population among CD4 + T cells compared to direct intracellular Foxp3 - staining in WT mice ( Figure 1A ) . Most importantly , no significant differences in the frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells during JHMV infection were found comparing the two groups ( data not shown ) . Validation of Foxp3 expression in DEREG mice thus facilitated characterization of Foxp3 + Treg kinetics during the course of infection . The frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + cells remained stable at ~ 15 % within CLN at all time points ( data not shown ) . By contrast , within both brain and spinal cord , Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells peaked at day 7 p . i . and then rapidly decreased at day 10 p . i . ( Figure 1B ) . However , while the frequency of Foxp3 + Tregs was maintained at ~ 10 % within the brain after day 10 p . i . ( Figure 1B ) , a sustained rebound was observed in spinal cords after day 14 p . i . during chronic infection ( Figure 1B ) . The sustained increase in the fraction of Foxp3 + T at later time points , specifically within the spinal cord , was not attributed to viral replication , as infectious virus is cleared by day 14 p . i . , and viral RNA levels continuously decline after day 10 p . i . ( 15 ) . Onset of robust demyelination in spinal cords at day 14 p . i . ( 12 ) rather implicates that the second wave of Tregs is pathology - driven and functions to limit emerging SR CD4 + T cell responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
