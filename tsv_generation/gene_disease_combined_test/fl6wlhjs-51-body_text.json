This is counter - intuitive , as we would expect that a model that includes the significant ARMA time series component ( Model 2 ) should outperform one that did not contain any time series components ( Model 3 ) . In practice there is a tradeoff between estimation and prediction . Table 4 displays the Akaike information criterions ( AICs ) for the four models , fit to the training data of the five EDs . For each ED , a smaller AIC denotes a model that better fits the data . Model 3 performed better than Model 2 in one - step - ahead predictions ( Figure 9 ) , but Model 2 better explains the training data than Model 3 ( Table 4 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 246}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
