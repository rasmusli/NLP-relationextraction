The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts and cause new human and zoonotic diseases . The genetic diversity of a viral population within a host may allow the virus to adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures and enable cross - species transmission events . In 2009 a large outbreak of rabies in Northern California involved a skunk rabies virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes , suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species . To better understand the evolution of rabies virus that enabled this host jump , we applied deep - sequencing analysis to rabies virus samples from the outbreak . Deepsequencing data indicated that many of the genetic changes associated with host jump occurred prior to 2009 , and these mutations were present at very low frequencies in viral populations from samples dating back to 1995 . These results suggest deep sequencing is useful for characterization of viral populations , and may provide insight to ancestral genomes and role of rare variants in viral emergence .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
