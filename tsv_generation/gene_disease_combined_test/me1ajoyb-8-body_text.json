Experimental data have also shown that patterns of the expression of genes related to the immune response are different in infected males and females [ 32 ] , and it is likely these differences have important roles in hantavirus ecology . Spillover to other rodent species also occurs [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , but it is unknown if the rodents remain infected . Recent work has shown that deer mice are experimentally susceptible to ANDV ; however , virus is cleared several weeks after infection [ 37 ] . A pronounced Th2 / Tfh gene expression profile occurs , including IL - 4 pathway activation , that does not appear to be substantially activated in SNV - infected deer mice [ 13 , 38 ] . This system provides an opportunity to identify viral and reservoir host factors that are important for sterilizing immunity that clears infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
