Temporal and genetic data indicate that the outbreak began in south Humboldt Co . and spread north to Arcata and three amino acid changes characterized samples from Arcata area and further north ( Table 2 ) . Whether or not these genetic changes contributed to the explosive increase in fox rabies that occurred primarily in Arcata during 2009 would require further study ( Fig . 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
