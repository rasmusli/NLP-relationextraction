Sensitivity of each virus to rfeIFN\u03b1 correlated with sensitivity to the Sup 2216 and induction of Mx in target cells by the supernatants highly correlated with the inhibition of all viruses ( Figure 5F - I ) . Finally , Sup 2216 derived from PBMCs of cats c08 , whose cells had indicated strong responsiveness to stimulation with ODN 2216 in previous experiments , most efficiently inhibited the replication of all viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
