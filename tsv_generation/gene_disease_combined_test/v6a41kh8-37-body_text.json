A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel . Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing LRTI in preschool children [ 64 ] . Atypical bacteria , like Mycoplasma pneumoniae , cause pneumonia more frequently in school - age children , but can also cause mild infections in younger children [ 65 ] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are the main bacterial pathogens causing childhood pneumonia . However , nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy , young children [ 66 ] . Moreover , their detection in pneumonia is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [ 67 ] , and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings . S . pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus - associated pneumonia in children in hospital , especially in cases with influenza and PIV types 1 to 3 [ 68 ] . The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic that peaked in December 2005 ( Figure 2 ) , which comprised the largest outbreaks of influenza A and B ( Figure 3 ) . There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease [ 69 ] . Additionally , we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed viral - bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an upper respiratory viral infection . Again , quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted casecontrol studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with pneumonia .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
