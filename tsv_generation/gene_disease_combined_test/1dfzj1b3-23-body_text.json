Peroxidation level evaluation using the ferric thiocyanate During linoleic acid oxidation , peroxides are formed ( primary products of oxidation ) , which oxidise Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + . The latter ions form a complex with thiocyanate , and this complex has a maximum absorbance at 500 nm . Therefore , high absorbance indicates high linoleic - acid oxidation . Using this method , some authors [ 42 ] found that Lavandula angustifolia Mill . oil from Australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied . Such oil was predominantly constituted by linalool and lynalyl acetate .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
