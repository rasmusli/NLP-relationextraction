Both factors are required for development of the pulmonary myocardium ( Mommersteeg et al . 2007 ; Ye et al . 2015 ) , which is also thought to have a pathological role in atrial fibrillation ( Chen et al . 1999 ) . A large body of literature has also been amassed to show that variants in genes regulating calcium handling lead to arrhythmia ( Table 6 ) . However , how the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker activity in atrial fibrillation patients is still unknown . Further , the underlying molecular identity of the pulmonary myocardium , including which ion channels and transcription factors are expressed in this tissue , has not been described in detail . We have used a systems - genetics approach to examine a large network of coexpressed genes simultaneously without prior knowledge of their identity , and have attempted to shed light on the relationships between transcriptional regulation , ion / calcium handling , contractile phenotypes , and the gene networks involved . By correlating variation in gene expression and known BXD genotypes in a genome - wide eQTL analysis we identified three regulatory loci associated with the expression of a cardiac gene network in the pulmonary myocardium .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 110}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
