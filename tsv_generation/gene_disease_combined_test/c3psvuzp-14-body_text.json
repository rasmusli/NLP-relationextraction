Despite high conservation in the rest of the PARP4 protein , the sequence and length of the largest exon ( corresponding to human exon 30 ) in PARP4 is highly variable among vertebrates . Consistent with our results in primates , all closely related pairs of vertebrate PARP4 orthologs analyzed demonstrated a signature of purifying selection throughout much of PARP4 contrasting with evidence for positive selection in the region corresponding to exon 30 of human PARP4 ( Figure 2D and Table S3 ) . To gain further insight into PARP4 evolution outside of primates , we asked whether other mammalian lineages show evidence for recurrent positive selection as we observed in primates . To do this , we took advantage of publicly available bat genome sequences , which , like primates , are divergent enough to provide sufficient evolutionary divergence , but not so divergent that the rate of synonymous mutation ( dS ) is saturated . Using sequences from 10 bat species ( Alignment S2 ) , we again found that PARP4 has evolved under recurrent positive selection in its largest exon ( PAML p - value , 0 . 0001 , PARRIS pvalue , 0 . 01 ) ( Figure S2B - C ) . PAML identified six positively sites with high confidence ( Figure S2B - C , Table S5 ) . Although there is no overlap between positively selected sites identified in primates and bats , we found nine residues to be absolutely conserved across all 25 primate and bat species we analyzed ( Figure S2B - C ) , suggesting substantial constraint even within this rapidly evolving disordered protein domain . Combined , these broader phylogenetic analyses indicate that a single PARP4 region has been subject to positive selection throughout mammalian and bird evolution , suggestive of an ancient conflict with intracellular pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 62}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
