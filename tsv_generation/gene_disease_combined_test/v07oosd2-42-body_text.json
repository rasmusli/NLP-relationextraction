Probiotic bacteria have also been shown to produce antimicrobial molecules , such as bacteriocins , and to inhibit the production of bacterial toxins or the adhesion of pathogens to the intestinal mucosa [ 123 ] . Several studies demonstrated that pre - treatment with certain probiotics , such as L . rhamnosus , was effective in reducing diarrhea in experimental ETEC : F4 PWD in pigs , possibly via the modulation of the intestinal microbiota , enhancement of intestinal antibody defense , and regulation of production of systemic inflammatory cytokine [ 128 ] . Recently , Lane et al . [ 129 ] reported that L . acidophilus supplementation ( 0 . 2 % ) in the weaned pig diet resulted in higher Lactobacillus counts and lower E . coli counts , as well as an increase in ADG and the average daily feed intake in supplemented pigs compared to the basal diet pigs . A Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis spore mixture ( BLS - mix ) was effective in preventing loss of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity after a challenge with ETEC :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
