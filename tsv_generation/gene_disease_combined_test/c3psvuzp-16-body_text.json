Combining these with publically available sequences , we aligned and analyzed 15 or more orthologs for each macro - PARP gene ( Table S1 , Figure S4 ) . Based on these expanded alignments , we confirmed the results of our initial screen ; all macro - PARP genes have evolved under positive selection in Figure 1A . The region of the protein corresponding to human exon 30 is bracketed in red . Also shown below the schematic is an amino acid identity plot calculated using seven publicly available primate PARP4 sequences . ( B ) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection from seven publically available PARP4 sequences using the entire gene , exon 30 alone or the entire gene except exon 30 . Columns are as in Figure 1B Table S3 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1004403 . g002 simian primates ( PAML p - value , 0 . 0001 , PARRIS p - value , 0 . 01 ) . In contrast to the recurrent positive selection on only a single exon of PARP4 , we found that positively selected sites were broadly distributed throughout the macro - PARP genes ( Figure 3A ) . For all three macro - PARPs , we observed strong evidence of positive selection acting on the macrodomains . However , removal of the macrodomain - containing segments did not result in a loss of positive selection signatures , indicating that both macrodomains as well as other domains have evolved under positive selection ( Figure 3B ) . For instance , we found significant evidence for positive selection in the PARP domain of PARP14 ( Figure 3B ) , similar to PARP13 [ 37 ] . In contrast , our analyses did not reveal evidence of positive selection acting on the PARP domains of PARP9 and PARP15 ( Figure 3B ) , although it is possible that sequencing of additional orthologs might reveal more subtle signatures of selection . Thus , we conclude that macro - PARPs are evolving very rapidly , including substantial positive selection in the macrodomains of all three macro - PARPs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
