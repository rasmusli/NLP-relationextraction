Ninety nm ultra - thin cryosections were made at \u2212 110 \u00b0 C on a LEICA UCT cryoultramicrotome . Sections were retrieved with a methylcellulose 2 % / sucrose 2 . 3 M mixture ( 1 : 1 ) and collected onto formvar / carbon coated nickel grids . Sections were incubated with anti - Flag and anti - p24 antibodies ( F7425 , Sigma and KAL - 1 , DAKO ) . After extensive washing , grids were incubated with gold - conjugated goat - anti - rabbit IgG ( Aurion ) and goat - anti - mouse IgG ( 10 and 5 nm , Sigma ) . Grids were washed , post - fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde and rinsed . Contrasting step was performed by incubating grids on drops of uranyl acetate 4 % / methycellulose 2 % mixture ( 1 : 10 ) . The sections were imaged on a transmission electron microscope at 100 kV ( JEOL 1011 , Tokyo , Japan ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 518, "end": 530}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
