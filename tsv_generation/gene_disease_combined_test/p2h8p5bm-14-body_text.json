KFDV is mainly transmitted by ticks belonging to the genus Hemaphysalis but other tick genera have also been shown to be able to transmit KFDV [ 64 , 65 ] . During hemorrhagic KFDV infection , the initial phase is similar to TBEV infection with fever and flu - like symptoms , but it may also include bleeding from the nose , mouth or gastrointestinal tract [ 65 , 66 ] . The second phase , which is experienced by 1 - 20 % of the cases , includes neurological symptoms such as headache , mental disturbance , and tremor , however , no evidence of meninges or encephalitis have been found [ 65 ] . There are about 400 - 500 reported annual cases of KFDV [ 47 ] , with case fatality rates ranging from 3 to 10 % [ 17 , 65 ] . In 1990 a KFDV vaccine was developed , although it provided some protection , due to low efficacy , the number of cases still increased from 1999 to 2012 [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] . Treatment of KFDV is limited to supportive care [ 47 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
