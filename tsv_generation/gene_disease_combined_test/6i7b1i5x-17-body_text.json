{"cord_uid": "6i7b1i5x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6514959", "divid": "17", "text": "The study that created antibodies A and J described a total of 44 heavy chain sequences and 61 light chain sequences . Other antibodies expressed , D and L , and showed no binding to ICIs . There was generally a lack of oligoclonal response with just six light chains duplicated and only the J heavy ( 3 times ) and three other heavy chains duplicated . As these antibodies were created with non - native heavy and light chain pairings , they may have non - specific interactions [ 108 ] . This is one of the major challenges in the burgeoning bispecific antibody field [ 109 ] . Evidence of in situ maturation of antibodies , such as A and J , also does not preclude such an antibody targeting a self - antigen . Notably , two other rare clones ( only one transcript each from the 44 sequence reads ) showed weak binding to the same spheroid ICIs . One of these weak binding antibodies ( antibody E ) also bound plasma cells directly and was subsequently shown to bind kappa chains of IG . This highlights the non - specific autoimmune potential of antibodies from these types of pathologic infiltrates , which will be reviewed later .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
