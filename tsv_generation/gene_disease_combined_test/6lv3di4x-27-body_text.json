After washing and removal of fat and connective tissue , the epithelium was treated with 0 . 1 % protease ( mass / volume [ m / v ] ; from Streptomyces griseus type XIV ; Sigma ) and desoxyribonuclease I ( 0 . 001 % m / v ; from bovine pancreas ; Sigma ) for release of epithelial cells . After 48 h the cells were harvested by gently scratching the apical surface and washed twice with PBS [UNK] / [UNK] . Between the washing steps , the cells were passed through a 100 - m cell strainer ( Becton , Dickinson ) . Then 2 [UNK] 10 6 cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture flasks coated with collagen types I and III ( VitroCol ; Sigma ) , in 25 ml of bronchial epithelial cell serum - free growth medium ( BEGM ; LHC basal medium supplemented ; Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with epidermal growth factor ( EGF , 25 ng / ml ; Thermo Fisher ) and retinoic acid ( 50 nM ; Sigma ) and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 . The medium was changed after 24 h and then every 2 to 3 days until confluence was reached . Cells were detached using trypsin ( Sigma ) and frozen in liquid nitrogen with 40 % FBS and 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ; Sigma ) in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium containing Glutamax and without phenol red ( DMEM ; Gibco , Thermo Fisher ) at 2 . 5 [UNK] 10 6 cells per tube . For ALI cultures , 12 - well inserts with a pore size of 0 . 4 m ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) were coated with collagen type IV ( Sigma ) , and 2 [UNK] 10 5 cells per insert were seeded in 500 l of BEGM ( EGF , 25 ng / ml ; Thermo Fisher ) and 1 ml in the lower chamber , and cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 . After 24 h , the insert medium was replaced , and then the medium in both chambers was changed every 2 to 3 days . After reaching confluence , the cells were shifted to ALI by removing the medium in the upper chamber , and in the basal chamber BEGM was replaced with ALI medium ( 1 : 1 [ vol / vol ] LHC basal medium plus DMEM , supplemented as BEGM with 1 ng / ml of EGF ; Thermo Fisher ) . Experiments were performed as soon as movement of cilia was visible , indicating full differentiation of cultures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 207}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
