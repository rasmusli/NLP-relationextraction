Class A CpG ODN ( CpG - A ) consist of CpG motifs in a phosphodiester core , flanked on both ends by phosphorothioate poly ( G ) sequences . CpG ODN of this class are characterized by their potential to both induce massive type I IFN secretion by pDCs [ 12 ] and increase NK cytotoxicity [ 21 ] , rendering them ideal candidates as prophylactic enhancers of innate immunity to viral infections . Conversely , class B CpG ODN ( CpG - B ) , which encode multiple CpG motifs on a phosphorothioate backbone , promote monocyte maturation and B cell activation , thus substantially supporting the development of humoral immune responses [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] . Both CpG - A and CpG - B have indicated immunostimulatory properties in immune cells of mice , primates and many domestic species in vitro [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] , while in vivo studies in outbred animals have mainly been carried out with CpG - B [ 24 , 32 , 33 ] . Concerning the cat , specifically synthesized CpG - A molecules were recently shown to induce IFN\u03b3 [ 34 ] ; CpG - B molecules indicated the capability to induce proliferation of feline cells [ 35 ] , and CpG - B - adjuvanted allergen indicated potential for immunotherapy in a feline asthma model [ 36 ] . Although class C [ 37 , 38 ] and class P ODN [ 39 ] were developed in more recent years in an effort to combine the advantageous effects of both CpG - A and CpG - B and increase immunogenicity , CpG - A remain the strongest inducers of type I IFN described to date .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
