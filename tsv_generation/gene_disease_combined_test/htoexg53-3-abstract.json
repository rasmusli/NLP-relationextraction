We have identified a H2 - d restricted decamer peptide epitope in the MERS - N protein with CD8 + T cell antigenicity . The identification of this epitope , and the availability of the MVA - MERS - N candidate vaccine , will help to evaluate MERS - N - specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine - mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of MERS - CoV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
