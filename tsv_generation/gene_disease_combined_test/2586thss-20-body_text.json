The data suggested that the full - length core protein and the new NS3 protein ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) were suitable for analyzing the presence of antibodies against individual HCV proteins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from chronic HCV infection . These results are in agreement with those of previous studies in which the putative nucleocapsid protein ( C ) and non - structural proteins ( NS3 ) were found to contain the most immunodominant epitopes ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 70}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
