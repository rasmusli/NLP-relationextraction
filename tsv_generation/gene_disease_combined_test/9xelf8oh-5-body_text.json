Use of a multiplex reaction was similarly limited , accounting for only 14 % ( 12 / 88 ) and 10 % ( 4 / 39 ) , respectively , of wildlife disease surveillance studies . The implication is that contemporary techniques in molecular epidemiology are underutilised in wildlife disease surveillance ( see also Benton et al . 2015 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
