Two hypergeometric tests have been conducted to compare the enrichment fold of LIRCPs in viruses against the host : one for proteins containing all combination of LIR patterns ( i . e . , either xLIR or WxxL , or both kind ) and another considering only the proteins containing at least one xLIR motif ( i . e . , xLIR patterns alone or along with one or more WxxL patterns ) . We observed that when all the possible combinations of LIR patterns are taken into account , there is an enrichment of putative LIR motifs in viruses compared with the host organism for all 4 model organisms tested . However , there is an enrichment of xLIR patterns in the host compared with the infecting viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 71}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
