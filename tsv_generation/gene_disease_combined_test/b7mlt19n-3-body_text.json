It is a catabolic mechanism that enables the removal of damaged or excess cellular organelles and proteins , thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and survival . 1 The autophagic machinery is highly conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans . Among the proteins that take part in this process , the Atg8 - family proteins play a central role . 2 Indeed , these proteins are involved in the elongation and maturation of the autophagosome and its fusion with lysosomes . 1 , 3 Phosphatidylethanolamine - conjugated Atg8 - family proteins reside on autophagosomal membranes where they can contribute to the recruitment of other core autophagy machinery proteins essential for the effective course of the autophagy process . 1 , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Although originally considered to be a nonselective bulk degradation mechanism , a gathering body of evidence over the past decade suggests that autophagy is much more selective than initially appreciated . Selective targeting of cellular components to autophagosomes for degradation relies on the existence of selective autophagy receptors able to recognize and tether cargos toward nascent autophagosomes . 8 , 9 Examples of selective autophagy include aggrephagy , mitophagy , lipophagy , and xenophagy . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The interaction between selective autophagy receptors and Atg8 - family proteins is essential for the proper steering of the cargo for degradation . These receptors typically contain an LC3 - interacting region ( LIR , also known as LRS , AIM or GIM ; the latter correspond to LC3 recognition sequence , Atg8 - interacting motif and GABARAP interaction motif respectively ) critical for the binding to Atg8 - family proteins . 7 , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The LIR motif consists of a short amino acid sequence with a core motif originally described as W / F / Y / L / V ( where ' x ' represents any amino acids , and referred to as WxxL hereafter ) . 7 , 18 This sequence has lately been relaxed and extended to 6 amino acids to integrate most of the experimentally verified LIRs . [ ILV ] , where the residues in positions 3 and 6 correspond to the most crucial ones for the interaction with Atg8 - family proteins . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Besides its role in cellular homeostasis , autophagy is also involved in the innate immune response against pathogens . 13 , 29 , 30 Recent years have seen an outburst of studies on autophagy and viral infections . Autophagy may exert a variety of antiviral functions , including the degradation of viral components ( known as virophagy ) , the activation of innate immunity by the delivery of viral nucleic acids to the Toll - like receptors , and adaptive immunity through the major histocompatibility complex II ( MCH - II / HLA class II ) , or the control of the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] However , to be successful , viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host defense . Several viruses have thus developed strategies to use the autophagy machinery or even thrive in the autophagosomes and promote their replication , spread , and survival . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Other viruses susceptible to autophagy have evolved mechanisms to counteract autophagy activation by expressing proteins that interfere with the cellular machinery , essentially inhibiting the autophagosome - lysosome fusion or interfering with early stages of autophagy activation . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] A few proteins from viruses infecting mammals and plants that interfere with the host autophagy process have been shown to associate with Atg8 - family proteins . 52 , [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Yet , only one LIRdependent interaction has been reported . 62 We have developed a database , iLIR @ viral ( http : / / ilir . uk / virus / ) , that organizes information on the presence of LIR motifs in viral proteins . Additionally , a curated text - mining analysis of the literature permitted us to predict functional LIR motifs in viral proteins that have already been shown to associate with Atg8 - family members .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 90}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
