Later , it was shown that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV - 1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) [ 64 ] . In this study , we could show that the addition of the DIs leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species and a reduction in Gag - processing . Thus , we speculated that the combinatory treatment of HLAC with DIs and proteasome inhibitors might synergistically inhibit virus replication . Si et al . have previously shown that DIs boost the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on Coxsackie virus replication [ 89 ] . However , in this case DIs alone had no effect on replication of Coxsackie virus and there was no supra - additive effect detectable , even when both inhibitors were added at high concentrations . Possibly , both inhibitors , proteasome inhibitors and DIs , are necessary Viruses 2017 , 9 , 222 16 of 22 to efficiently reduce the pool of free Ub , which has been shown to be necessary to block Coxsackie virus replication [ 89 ] . On the contrary , our data illustrate that DIs can enhance the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the inhibition of HIV - 1 replication at very low , supra - effective concentration levels of both inhibitors . When applied individually , neither proteasome inhibitors nor DIs had any influence on the HIV - 1 replication at these low concentrations . Thus , our results suggest that both inhibitors , DIs and proteasome inhibitors induce synergistic effects , without affecting cell viability .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 67}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
