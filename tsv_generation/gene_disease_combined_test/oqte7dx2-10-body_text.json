First , hippocampal immunohistochemistry showed reduced expression of the GABA synthesis enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD67 ) in USP46 ( K92 ) mutants ( Tomida et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that USP46 may regulate GABA synthesis . Second , muscimol - induced postsynaptic GABA A receptor currents were slightly reduced in hippocampal neurons of USP46 ( K92 ) mutants . This effect may be mediated by extrasynaptic GABA A receptors since no alterations were observed in mIPSC amplitude or frequency ( Tomida et al . , 2009 ) . Third , administration of the GABA A receptor agonist , nitrazepam , restores depression - like behavior in USP46 ( K92 ) and KO mutant mice , and these effects could be blocked by the GABA A receptor antagonist flumazenil ( Imai et al . , 2012 ) . Together , these data suggest that USP46 affects both preand postsynaptic components of the GABA system , however the precise mechanism is not known . One possibility is that USP46 may indirectly affect the GABA system as a compensatory response to a primary defect in AMPAR degradation in excitatory neurons . It will be important in the future to test if USP46 functions in GABA neurons and whether it directly deubiquitinates components of the GABA system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
