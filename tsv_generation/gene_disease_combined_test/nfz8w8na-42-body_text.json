Siegel ( 2015 ) echoes a similar criticism in noting that development aid was used in contexts with insufficient infrastructures for the aid to be effective and focused too heavily on issues unrelated to Ebola ( Nunes 2016 ) . The international responses are argued to be far too short term , framing the Ebola epidemic as an African , and therefore racialized problem ( Jones 2011 ) , leading to global neglect of the disease . This scholarly evaluation of global responses to the Ebola virus politicizes the epidemic , calling into question the evidence used to inform response pathways , which were largely insufficient and inappropriate for the Liberian context . More credible sources of evidence would have considered the urgency of Ebola and the unique sociopolitical context in which it was spreading .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
