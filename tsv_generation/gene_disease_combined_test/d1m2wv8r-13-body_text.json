Enriched functions of the DEPs at 12 hpi were mainly related to the cell cycle , including regulation of the mitotic phase of the cell cycle . At 24 hpi , numerous proteins involved in RNA processing were enriched . By 36 hpi , the DEPs were significantly enriched in proteins related to chromatin assembly ( p = 1 . 88E - 14 ) . At 48 hpi , enriched functions were related to cellular macromolecular complex assembly ( p = 3 . 91E - 08 ) and regulation of organelle organisation ( p = 2 . 99E - 05 ) . The functional terms in the regulation of apoptosis were enriched at each time point ; but at 60 hpi , proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis became the largest component ( 8 . 51 % ) of all DEPs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
