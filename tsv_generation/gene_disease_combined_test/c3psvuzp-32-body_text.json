Maximum likelihood ( ML ) tests were performed with codeml in the PAML software suite [ 40 ] . Aligned sequences were subjected to ML tests using NS sites models disallowing ( M8a ) or allowing ( M8 ) positive selection . The p - value reported is the result of a chi - squared test on twice the difference of the likelihood values between the two models using one degree of freedom . All analyses were consistent when performed with varying models of codon frequency ( F61 and F364 ) and varied starting omega values ( 0 . 4 and 1 . 5 ) . Residues with recurrent signatures of positive selection with a posterior probability greater than 0 . 95 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes ( BEB ) analysis in PAML and the F364 codon frequency model . A second set of maximum likelihood tests was performed using PARRIS in the HyPhy software suite [ 41 ] , which also compares models disallowing or allowing positive selection . We report twice the difference in the log likelihood values ( LRT ) , and a p - value based on that difference . Signatures of episodic positive selection were calculated in two ways . Overall dN / dS ratios for each branch of the phylogenetic tree were calculated using the free ratio model in PAML . A branch - site test ( Branchsite REL [ 42 ] ) for statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection was performed using the HyPhy software suite [ 41 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
