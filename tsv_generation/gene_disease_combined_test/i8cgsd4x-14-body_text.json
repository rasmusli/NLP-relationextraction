To determine whether CxCul4 plays a similar role during WNV infection , Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid expressing CxCul4 and infected with WNV 24 h post - transfection . Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real - time RT - qPCR was performed using primers for Vir1 , a reporter gene regulated by Jak - STAT pathway [ 34 ] , and CxVago , a reporter gene regulated by the TRAF - Rel2 pathway [ 35 ] . As expected , expression of both CxVir1 and CxVago was upregulated following WNV infection . However , whilst there was no significant difference in CxVago expression following CxCul4 overexpression , CxVir1 upregulation was suppressed significantly in CxCul4 - overexpressing cells compared with empty vector transfected cells ( Fig 4A ) . Previous studies have shown that , once expressed , CxVago is secreted and activates the Jak - STAT pathway in Culex cells [ 7 ] . Therefore , Hsu cells were transfected with CxVago and the supernatant medium was collected 72 h post - transfection . Fresh Hsu cells were then transfected with the CxCul4 overexpression plasmid and , at 24 h post - transfection , the medium was replaced with medium containing CxVago to activate the Jak - STAT pathway . Real - time RT - qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 h after media replacement showed expression of CxVir1 was upregulated in control ( empty vector transfected ) cells but upregulation of CxVir1 was suppressed significantly in cells overexpressing CxCul4 ( Fig 4B ) . These results indicate that CxCul4 functions to inhibit the Jak - STAT pathway in Culex cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 49}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
