Therefore , we next compare the quality of results obtained by HFold , HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold when given a pseudoknot - free input , G that is predicted by existing computational methods . One way to produce an input structure is to use an MFE pseudoknot - free structure prediction method , such as MFold . We chose SimFold as it is an implementation of MFold and , because of its energy parameters , gives more accurate predictions than MFold . Of course , when comparative information is available , the user can input such information as structural constraint as a pseudoknot - free structure to Iterative HFold and expect a better prediction result . Here we compare two methods for predicting G , namely SimFold and the hotspots produced by HotKnots V2 . 0 . Table 2 reports the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence intervals of average F - measures . The accuracy of HFold - PKonly is significantly worse than that of HFold and Iterative HFold , both with the output of SimFold , and with the HotKnots hotspots as input , so we do not discuss HFold - PKonly further .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
