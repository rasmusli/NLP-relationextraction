Following JHMV infection , T cell migration to the CNS is regulated by CXCR3 , as well as CCR2 and CCR5 ( 33 ) ( 34 ) ( 35 ) . However , expression of their respective ligands , CXCL9 , CXCL10 , CCL2 , and CCL5 was not affected by Foxp3 + Treg ablation within brain or spinal cord ( Figure 6A ) . However , Foxp3 + Tregs have been reported to limit inflammatory chemokine expression within draining lymph nodes , thereby promoting T cell egress ( 36 ) . Elevated T cell activation and IFN - \u03b3 mRNA in CLN were indeed associated with significantly increased levels of IFN - \u03b3 inducible CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA levels in CLN of Foxp3 + Treg depleted DTR + mice ( Figure 6B ) . Similarly , CXCR3 expression on CD4 + T cells was upregulated in CLN ( Figure 6C ) . By contrast , there were no differences in CCL2 and CCL5 mRNA expression ( Figure 6B ) , indicating a preferential increase of IFN - \u03b3 regulated chemokines ( 37 , 38 ) . These results supported the notion that enhanced and / or prolonged interaction of CXCR3 ligand expressing APC with CXCR3 + T cells may promote retention , thereby limiting T cell egress into circulation ( 39 ) . Overall , these results indicate that Foxp3 + Tregs mediate suppressive function primarily within CLN and are more potent at controlling peripheral SR T cell activation than virus - specific T cells during chronic JHMV infection . reduced Tr1 cell response correlates with increased cns sr T cells Unaltered SR T cell responses within the CNS of DT - treated DTR + mice indicated a Foxp3 - independent component regulating the CNS autoimmune response during chronic JHMV infection . In addition to Foxp3 + Tregs , IL - 10 - producing Tr1 cells also regulate autoimmune responses , including during MS ( 40 , 41 ) . Tr1 cells are drastically reduced in JHMV - infected mice deficient in IL - 27 signaling , a cytokine promoting Tr1 cell response ( 15 ) . Analysis of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice further demonstrated that IL - 27 does not play a pro - inflammatory role or significantly alter CD8 T cell function during JHMV infection but is rather a major regulator of the Tr1 response ( 15 ) . Myelin - specific CD4 + T cell responses were therefore compared in infected WT and IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice at d30 p . i . , the peak of the SR T cell response ( 13 ) . Opposing the results in Foxp3 + Treg depleted mice , frequencies and numbers of both virus - and myelin - specific CD4 + T cells were similar within CLN of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice compared to controls ( Figure 7A ) . Furthermore , frequencies of both virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells were significantly increased within the CNS of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice compared to WT mice ( Figure 7B ) . Interestingly , alteration of CD4 + T cell frequencies in the absence of Tr1 cells was more prominent for myelin - specific compared to virus - specific T cells ( fivefold versus twofold , respectively ) , indicating preferential action on SR T cells . Moreover , despite similar overall inflammatory cell numbers , numbers of virus and SR CD4 + T cells were increased in the absence of Tr1 cells ( Figure 7B ) . Tr1 cells thus do not appear to regulate peripheral SR CD4 + T cell responses but act preferentially within the CNS during chronic JHMV infection . These data indicate that regulation of SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection is dependent upon Tr1 cells within the CNS , contrasting the specific role of Foxp3 + Tregs within CLN .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 63}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
