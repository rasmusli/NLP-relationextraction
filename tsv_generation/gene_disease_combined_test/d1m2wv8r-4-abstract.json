The VP1 and VP2 proteins contain the most important antigenic epitopes , which are targeted by neutralising antibodies . VP2 , which represents 90 % of the viral capsid , also functions as a viral ligand that determines the viral host specificity and tissue affinity 4 . NS1 , a pleiotropic phosphoprotein , is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of CPV - infected cells . For instance , NS1 of CPV - 2 has been shown to induce caspase - dependent and p53 - independent apoptosis 5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 15}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
