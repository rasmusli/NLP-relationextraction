Nef colocalizes with LC3 and BECN1 , and contributes to the inhibition of autophagic maturation , thus protecting the virus from elimination by autophagy . 61 , 67 The proteins TRS1 from human cytomegalovirus and neurovirulence factor ICP34 . 5 from human herpesvirus ( HSV ) both interact with BECN1 via a specific BECN1 - binding domain . This interaction is required for the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and fusion with the lysosomes . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] 73 While iLIR could detect several WxxL motifs in TRS1 sequence , a single one in an intrinsically disordered region was identified for ICP34 . 5 whose sequence ( 64 - RQWLHV - 69 ) is quite well conserved among 4 strains of HSV - 1 and one strain of HSV - 2 . However , to date , there is no evidence of association between ICP34 . 5 and LC3 proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 45}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
