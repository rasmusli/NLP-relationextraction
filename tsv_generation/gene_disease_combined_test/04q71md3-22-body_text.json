The trunk or backbone of phylogenies reconstructed from temporally - sampled hemagglutinin genes ( Fig . 3 ) represents the lineage that successfully persists from one epidemic year to the next [ 14 , 33 ] . We determine the spatial history of this lineage using Markov rewards in the posterior tree distribution , thereby estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of the trunk lineage from 2002 to 2006 ( Fig . 3 ) . These estimates provide strong support for mainland China as the principal H3N2 source population , occupying close to 60 % of the trunk time in the H3N2 phylogenies ( Fig . 3 ) , followed by Southeast Asia , which comprises about 15 % of the trunk time . We further examine temporal heterogeneity in the source - sink process by combining a summary of the estimated trunk location through time together with an phylogenetic summary in Fig . 3 impact of temporal sampling heterogeneity on these estimates because the Southeast Asian trunk dominance precedes a period of higher sampling availability for Southeast Asia relative to mainland China ( Fig . 3 ) . The important role of mainland China in seeding the global seasonal spread of human influenza results in a high net migration out of this air community ( Fig . S4 ) . However , air communities that do not contribute significantly to the trunk can also maintain high net outflow , in particular the USA , which may be seeded by relatively few introductions each year whilst exporting comparatively more viruses to other locations during the epidemic season .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
