Under these conditions , cell lysates displayed a robust expression of all viral proteins tested . When viruses were analyzed , no notable variations were observed in the amount of Gag and Env present in the different preparations produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs ( Figure 2A for a WB analysis and Additional file 1 : Figure S1B for a precise quantification of gp120 and p24 by ELISA ) . Surprisingly , IFITMs were detected in viral preparations , suggesting that they could be virion - associated proteins . Next , we produced HIV - 1 viral particles in the presence of a variable amount of IFITMs by transfecting different amounts of IFITMcoding DNAs for a constant amount of Gag - Pol and Env DNAs . Purified virion particles were then normalized by exo - RT and either analyzed by WB ( Figure 2B ) , or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells ( Figure 2C ) . IFITMs were incorporated in a dose dependent manner in virion particles and the infectivity of virion particles decreased proportionally to the levels of IFITMs incorporated , overall suggesting a dose response inhibition of IFITMs on viral infectivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 24}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
