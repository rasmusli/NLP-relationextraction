Briefly , pAPN at 10 mg / mL concentration in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH7 . 2 and 200 mM NaCl was crystallized by itself and then amino acid was soaked into the pAPN crystal . Crystallization of pAPN was set up with 1 \u00b5L protein solution and 1 \u00b5L well solution containing 18 % PEG3350 , 200 mM Li 2 SO4 , and 100 mM HEPES pH7 . 2 mixed together in sitting drops . Crystals of pAPN were grown at 4 \u00b0 C for two weeks , and were then transferred to amino acid - soaking solution containing 5 mM amino acid , 20 % ethylene glycol , 25 % PEG3350 , 200 mM Li 2 SO4 , and 100 mM HEPES pH7 . 2 for another two days . The crystals were flash frozen in liquid N2 and used for data collection . Data were collected at APS beamline 24 - ID and ALS beamline 4 . 2 . 2 . X - ray diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 36 . The structures of pAPN complexed different amino acids were determined by directly refining the model of the unliganded pAPN structure ( PDB 4FKE ) against the amino acid - soaked crystal data . Programs CNS 37 and CCP4 refmac 38 were used for structure refinement . Program COOT was used for model building and structural superposition 39 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
