Briefly , sections were dewaxed , rehydrated , and subjected to 20 min of heatinduced epitope retrieval ( HIER ) ( pressure cooker ) in Tris buffered saline ( TBS ) / EDTA buffer , pH 9 . 0 ( Vector Laboratories ) . After 15 min cooling at room temperature , sections were washed in TBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) and incubated in anti - TNNI3 primary antibody or mouse IgG isotype control ( 2 mg / ml in 3 % fish skin gelatin in TBS ) overnight at 4 \u00b0 . Sections were then washed in TBS for 1 hr before incubating in Mouse on Mouse Polymer ( Abcam ) for 30 min , washed in TBS , and incubated with diaminobenzidine ( 0 . 4 mg / ml , 3 min ) . Sections were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin , blued with Scotts Tap Water Substitute , washed and dehydrated through graded alcohols to xylene , then coverslipped with Depex mounting medium . Cardiac a - actin ( ACTC1 ) was detected with a mouse monoclonal IgG 1 antibody ( Simga - Aldrich , clone Ac1 - 20 . 4 . 2 ) , or mouse isotype control at 5 mg / ml , with the same protocol as above but with HIER in citrate buffer with pH 6 . 0 ( Vector Laboratories ) . The presence of smooth muscle a - actin ( ACTA2 ) was detected in a similar fashion , using mouse monoclonal IgG 2a antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich , clone 1A4 ) at 9 mg / ml , and detection as above , but without HIER . Tissue was permeablized with 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min prior to the application of the primary antibody . Digital images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope XT digital slide scanner ( Leica Technologies ) . Images are typically of the left lobe and right middle lobe of four mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
