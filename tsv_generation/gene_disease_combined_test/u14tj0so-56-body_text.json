IPknot and HotKnots are completely written in C and so we can easily find their memory usage by running Valgrind . However , Iterative HFold program is a perl script that runs a few C programs ( HFold , HFold - pkonly and SimFold ) sequentially . So we find the memory usage of each C component using Valgrind and assign the maximum as the memory usage of Iterative HFold .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 151}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
