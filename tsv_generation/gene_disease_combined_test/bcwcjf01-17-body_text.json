S1 legend [ 17 , 18 ] . Briefly , all mismatched read pairs in the ORPs were identified as sequencing errors and removed from analysis . Erroneous matching read pairs in the plasmid control were used to estimate the overall PCR error rate [ 17 , 18 ] . Rates of these two types of errors were then combined in a position - dependent bionomial error model to make variant calls . The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura - Nei model . The tree with the highest log likelihood ( - 14363 . 5660 ) is shown . The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches . Initial tree ( s ) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows . When the number of common sites was , 100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites , the maximum parsimony method was used ; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used . The tree is drawn to scale , with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site . The analysis involved 32 nucleotide sequences . All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated . There were a total of 9669 positions in the final dataset . Bootstrap values ( percentage from 500 replications ) are shown for the relevant nodes . Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [ 28 ] .
