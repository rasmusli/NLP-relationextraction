An accelerated progression of fibrosis is noted in those recipients with recurrent HCV after transplant , and at least 25 to 30 % of patients will eventually develop liver cirrhosis within 5 to 10 years [ 53 , 54 ] . Once liver cirrhosis is established , the first episode of decompensation may occur in as high as 40 % of patients within 1 year . Apart from the rapid progression of fibrosis , recipients with recurrent hepatitis C may also develop severe fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis , characterized by jaundice , rapidly after organ transplantation in the absence of biliary obstruction causing a very high risk of graft failure [ 55 ] . For the reason , HCV - related recipients show a worse posttransplant outcome compared to HCV - negative recipients . A previous study which retrospectively analyzed 11036 patients with 11791 liver transplants confirmed that the HCV infection significantly impaired patient and graft survival after LT [ 56 ] . Focusing on the strategy to recurrent HCV infection after LT , three approaches have been identified according to the timing of treatment : pretransplantation antiviral therapy , posttransplantation prevention and preemptive treatment , and treatment for established reinfection . [ 58 ] . It is noteworthy that none of the patients who achieved SVR before LT developed graft reinfection in the study . In addition to the relative poor efficacy , safety of pegylated IFN is another concern in patients with decompensated cirrhosis . Carrion et al . reported that 43 % , 29 % , and 8 % of patients suffered from discontinuation , decompensation , and death during therapy [ 57 ] . Although the incidence of decompensation and death is similar in comparison to control group , treated patients suffered from a significantly higher rate of bacterial infection than control group . Child - Pugh B / C is the only independent factor associated with bacterial infection . These data suggested that patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be closely monitored during Pegylated IFN therapy and followed by experts with considerable experience . Direct acting antivirals ( DAAs ) , including protease , polymerase or other nonstructural protein inhibitors , are the newly developed agents for HCV treatment . Current data on HCV treatment using DAA are limited in patients with cirrhosis . In the phase III trials with telaprevir and boceprevir , there were only a few patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis included [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] . Although the results from the phase III trials of telaprevir and boceprevir triple therapy showed a higher SVR rates compared to Pegylated IFN / RBV therapy in advanced fibrosis and cirrhotic patients , the severe advanced events rates were also increased in patients receiving triple therapy . The data from compassionate use of protease inhibitors in viral C cirrhosis ( CUPIC ) cohort also demonstrated an increased serious adverse events rates ( from 30 % to 51 % ) and discontinuation rates ( from 7 % to 12 % ) in cirrhotic nonresponders compared to the phase III trials . Another study in 20 cirrhotic patients awaiting LT demonstrated that 71 % of patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks with DAA triple therapy . However , 25 % of patients suffered from early discontinuation , and 10 % of patients had decompensation during therapy . The results suggest that triple therapy must be administered cautiously with intensive safety monitoring in cirrhotic patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1541, "end": 1555}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
