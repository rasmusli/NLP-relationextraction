These three counties have a high number of cattle farms and livestock movements , and therefore epidemics starting in these counties are more likely to produce a high number of cases than in other parts of the UK . Cumbria and Devon were also two major hotspots of infection during the UK FMD outbreak in 2001 [ 3 ] . A random source farm in each county was infected initially for each simulation , and we investigated the predicted final epidemic size , duration , peak size and the model prediction of the geographical spread of disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
