However , tissue samples from the gastrointestinal tract ( i . e . stomach , large intestine and faeces ) yielded low numbers of the virus ( e . g . small intestine RQ mean = 0 . 00009 \u00b1 0 . 0001 CI , n = 8 ) and with only a quarter ( 0 . 25 ( 2 / 8 ) , 0 . 05 - 0 . 64 CI ) of the infected grey squirrels showing a positive result in the small intestinal tissue . Interestingly , values of RQ in the spleen were somewhat higher ( RQ mean = 0 . 0007 \u00b1 0 . 0009 CI , n = 8 ) , with viral presence in half ( 0 . 5 ( 4 / 8 ) , 0 . 18 - 0 . 82 CI ) of the SADV - positive animals . The findings in the spleen are also complemented with a high proportion of viral presence in the blood ( 0 . 86 ( 6 / 7 ) , 0 . 42 - 0 . 99 CI , n = 7 ) all - be - it with relatively low quantity of virus ( RQ mean = 0 . 0003 \u00b1 0 . 0002 CI , n = 7 ) . All other samples / tissues showed a low prevalence of infection ( \u2264 0 . 13 ( 1 / 8 ) , 0 . 01 - 0 . 53 CI ) ( Fig . 2c ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
