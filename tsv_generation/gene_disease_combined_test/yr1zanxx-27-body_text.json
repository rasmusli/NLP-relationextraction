Genetic studies have confirmed the relevance of inflammatory response in common neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer ' s disease and multiple sclerosis , indicating that neuroinflammation is likely implicated in the primary pathogenesis , rather than a secondary response [ 73 ] . We and others have reported that microglia impact neurocognitive function by executing complement - mediated synapse elimination [ 8 , 74 , 75 ] . Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation , researchers have attempted to use CSF1R antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of models to improve neurological function , including traumatic brain injury [ 38 , 39 ] , brain irradiation [ 50 ] , myelin - induced catatonia [ 76 ] , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [ 40 ] , and Alzheimer ' s disease [ 41 ] . However , our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in the CNS , as well as decreased peripheral APC activation . Thus , in assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism , it will be important to consider the diminished immune response in both the CNS and peripheral immune compartments .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
