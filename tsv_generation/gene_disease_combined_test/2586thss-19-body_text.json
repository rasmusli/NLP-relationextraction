The purpose of synthesizing these segments is to determine which segments encoded by the genome are significant for the development of anti - HCV assays and to find a multiple epitope fusion antigen which incorporates all of the major immunodominant epitopes from the functional regions of the HCV genome . Therefore , we first constructed the different HCV segments into vectors containing His - tag or GST - tag to induce expression . The proteins were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells as fusion proteins with a 26 kDa GST - tag or 18 kDa His - tag used for detection and affinity purification . The immunogenicity of the tagged fusion proteins was analyzed using HCV strip analysis with standard positive and negative anti - HCV sera . Our results showed that the recombinant soluble proteins were expressed successfully . The sera studied recognized the core and NS3 protein at very high levels , whereas the other proteins , such as NS4B , NS4A , NS5A and NS5B , were found to have lower levels of reactivity . The E2 protein rarely reacted with anti - HCV positive serum . Thus , the core protein in combination with a new NS3 protein ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) constitutes almost all of the major immunogenic proteins of the HCV . However , this study does not exclude the possibility that the low reactivity to some HCV antigens is due to a quantitative reduction in the titer of antibodies and not due to an absence of reactivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
