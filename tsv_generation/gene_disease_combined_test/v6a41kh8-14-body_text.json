The lower of the two counts was used in the analyses . Children were weighed using a UNICEF electronic scale ( SECA , Hamburg , Germany ) accurate to 100 g with a mother / child - function , so the weight of the child could be determined while held by his or her mother . The child ' s length / height was measured to the nearest 0 . 1 cm using a wooden measuring board ( as recumbent length in children < 2 years of age and as height in children \u2265 2 years of age ) . Oxygen saturation ( SpO 2 ) was measured either on a finger or a toe with a pulse oxymeter ( Siemens MicO2 , Siemens Medical Systems Inc , Danvers , MA , USA ) using a pediatric sensor ( Nellcor , Pleasanton , CA , USA ) . It was recorded twice 1 min apart after stabilization of the sensor for 1 min . The higher of the two measurements was used in the analyses . The concentration of C - reactive protein ( CRP ) was determined from a capillary or venous blood specimen using a semi - quantitative rapid test ( QuikRead \u00ae CRP , Orion Diagnostica , Espoo , Finland ) and a portable photometer ( QuikRead \u00ae 101 , Orion Diagnostica ) according to the manufacturer ' s instruction . The test had a measurement range of 8 to 160 mg / L and values outside the measurement range were indicated as < 8 or > 160 mg / L . NPA specimens were obtained using a sterile , disposable suction catheter ( Pennine Healthcare Ltd , Derbyshire , Study profile for children 2 to 35 months of age included in a study of viral community - acquired pneumonia in Bhaktapur , Nepal , from July 2004 to June 2007 Figure 1 Study profile for children 2 to 35 months of age included in a study of viral community - acquired pneumonia in Bhaktapur , Nepal , from July 2004 to June 2007 .

Severe anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 7 g / dl .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 990, "end": 1011}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
