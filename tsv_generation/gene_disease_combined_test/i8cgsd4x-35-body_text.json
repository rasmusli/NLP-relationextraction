In brief , supernatant media from cells infected with WNV ( 10 - fold dilutions ) were added onto confluent Vero cell monolayers in 6 - well plates . After 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0 C , the cells were overlaid with medium containing agar . Plaques formed within 72 hpi were counted and the results were plotted graphically . The experiments were conducted at least twice , each with duplicates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
