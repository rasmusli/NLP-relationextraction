However , it may cross - react with seasonal human coronavirus antibodies , so a spike protein - specific IFA is required for confirmation . PRNT is a definitive test when ELISA and IFA have inconclusive results [ 25 ] . Only 10 % of ELISA - positive results are positive on a neutralization assay [ 25 ] . In our study , 1 of 7 patients with borderline or positive ELISA results also had positive results in PRNT . Therefore , the results obtained in our study are accurate because ELISA , IFA , and PRNT were used .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
