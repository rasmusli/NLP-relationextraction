Cp - NanI CD in complex with diplacone has the same side - chain orientation of Asp291 as in the substrate ( Neu5Ac ) complex . In addition , an extra water molecule ( W1 ) rather than the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac stabilizes the diplacone complex . Therefore , together with the kinetic inhibition assay , the structure of the Cp - NanI CDdiplacone complex suggests that diplacone binds to the same substrate - binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 92}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
