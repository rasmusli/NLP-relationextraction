This specific patient group should receive appropriate controller therapy , but leaning on following outpatients ' visits has been demonstrated not to be reliable , as shown by a study on 3435 ED visits for asthma in children , only 18 % of whom had a prescription for inhaled corticosteroids in the 2 months following the ED visit , only 12 % attended follow - up appointments , and only 5 . 2 % received both [ 25 ] . Even if the guidelines do not state that ED physicians should identify children with persistent asthma and start long - term therapy , some authors suggest that , in appropriate patients , inhaled corticosteroids might be prescribed at ED discharge [ 24 , 26 ] ; however , the rates of such prescriptions are low [ 25 , 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
