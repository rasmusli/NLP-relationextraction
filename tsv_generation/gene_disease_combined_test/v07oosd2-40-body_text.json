In fact , the use of organic acids in weaned piglets was associated with a reduction of stomach pH [ 118 ] . With this effect , organic acids generate a hostile gastric environment for bacterial survival . Moreover , organic acids promote the conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin in the stomach of pigs , and promote the activity of this enzyme [ 108 ] . On the other hand , decreasing the intestinal pH is probably not a primary effect of feeding organic acids in pigs . Indeed , Risley et al . [ 119 ] reported a non significant decrease in the pH of the small intestine in 3 - week - old weanling pigs fed with a diet supplemented with 1 . 5 % fumaric or citric acid . Addition of organic acids to weaned pig diets improved growth performance and health [ 31 ] as well as the local immunity in the jejunum epithelium [ 120 ] . It was reported that regardless of the organic acids used in the feed , these compounds reduced the incidence and severity of diarrhea in pigs , and improved the performance of the treated group compared to that of the negative control group [ 121 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
