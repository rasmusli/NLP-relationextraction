When used in conjunction with primers for the plant sequence at the border of each event , they are able to detect each event ( Figure 2 ) . Since they have 50 % of primers in common , it was important to determine whether there was any cross reaction between the assays . Specificity of the two assays was tested using plasmid DNA for each event . No cross - reaction between the two targets was observed ( Figure 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 45}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
