After 24 h , cells were infected with WNV and luciferase activity was measured 16 hpi . The results showed that CxCul4 knockdown resulted in increased luciferase activity in WNV - infected cells using anti - WNV NS5 and anti - \u03b2 - actin antibodies conducted on lysates collected from cells treated as in B . Molecular weight markers represented as kDa . The band at around 95 kDa is expected size of WNV - NS5 ; while band at 191 kDa is non - specific . E . Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as a transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi . Total RNA was collected from cells and real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and Cul4 - transfected cells ) . F . Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in E . G . Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid . Empty vector ( Empty ) was used as a transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi . Western blot was performed using anti - V5 ( detecting CxCul4 overexpression ) and anti - \u03b2 - actin antibodies . Molecular weight markers represented as kDa . Culex cullin ( Cul4 ) blocks the Jak - STAT pathway . A . Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin ( CxCul4 ) . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1 - specific and Culex Vago - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and Cul4 - overexpressing cells ) . B . Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin ( CxCul4 ) . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were treated with CxVago - containing medium and total RNA was collected 48 h later . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three ( Fig 4C ) . As a positive control , cells were stimulated with heat - inactivated E . coli for 1 h , which also showed increased luciferase activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
