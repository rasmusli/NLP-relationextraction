In case of influenza A H1N1 09 ( ' swine flu ' ) serotype , in addition to human housekeeping gene control fragments , the presence of the influenza A generic PCR fragment as well as the H1N1 general signal was required to mark a sample as positive for H1N1 RNA . The detected ' swine flu ' positive samples were subjected to sequencing by cloning and subsequent sequencing for matrix ( GU322021 . 1 , NCBI ) , neuraminidase ( GU361110 . 1 , NCBI ) and hemagglutinin ( GU727573 . 1 , NCBI ) genes to confirm viral diagnosis .
