The conserved sequence C2717 - C2740 - C2742 - C2767 in the NS5A protein has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [ 7 ] . It has been shown that NS5A regulates viral RNA replication through binding to NS5B ( viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase [ RdRp ] ) and 3 1 - UTR [ 8 ] . The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , another member of the family Flaviviridae , is an essential component of the replication complex [ 9 ] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [ 10 , 11 ] . The HCV NS5A - Core interaction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS5A and the production of infectious virus [ 12 ] . The HCV NS5A also plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [ 13 , 14 ] . In addition , the CSFV NS5A decreases IRES - mediated translation in a dose - dependent manner and the key sites ( K399 , T401 , E406 and L413 ) are also found in BVDV , BDV and HCV [ 15 ] . To date , studies have been focused on the roles of the CSFV NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [ 8 , 15 ] , but knowledge of NS5A - interacting host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
