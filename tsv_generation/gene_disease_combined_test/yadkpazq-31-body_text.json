We show that ODN 2216 , the first described CpG - A [ 12 ] , can upregulate the expression of a series of genes in feline immune cells that play important roles in early responses to viruses . Soluble molecules produced by feline PBMCs upon ODN 2216 stimulation significantly increased resistance of various feline target cell lines to propagation of viruses from five different families , namely FCV , FPV , FHV , FCoV and FeLV . The observed repression of viral replication highly correlated with the mRNA expression of type I IFN genes in stimulated PBMCs as well as the induction , prior to inoculation , of antiviral mechanisms in the target cells . Furthermore , a single administration of ODN 2216 significantly increased the expression of Mx in the blood of treated cats . Plasma from these animals could also inhibit replication of FCV in vitro . Our data underline the prophylactic potential of ODN 2216 in an outbred species as a stand - alone agent and against a large range of viral pathogens simultaneously . Cats may highly benefit from such a molecule when placed in environments with strong infectious pressure such as catteries , shelters or pet shows .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 697, "end": 714}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
