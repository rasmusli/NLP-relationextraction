The central role of PGE2 in tumor - genesis has been further confirmed through homozygous deletion of its receptors . Mice with homozygous deletion in EP1 and EP4 receptors , but not EP3 , were partially resistant to colon carcinogen mediated induction of aberrant crypt foci [ 41 , 42 ] . EP2 disruption decreases the number and size of intestinal polyps in APC [UNK] 716 knockout mice [ 43 ] . In addition to colorectal cancer , it has been shown that EP1 , 2 , and 4 receptors were elevated whereas EP3 receptor levels were decreased in mammary tumors in COX - 2 - MMTV mice [ 44 ] . It was showed that PGE 2 promotes lung cancer cell migration via EP4 - betaArrestin1 - c - Src pathway [ 45 ] . In this study , blockade of EP4 by antagonists or by EP4 siRNA resulted in reduced PDK1 protein expression and activity of PDK1 promoter , suggesting that EP4 mediates the effect of PGE2 on PDK1 expression in normal bronchial epithelial cells . The EP4 receptor can activate several pathways that involve cell proliferation , adhesion , invasion and migration . These main molecules include G protein , adenylyl cyclase , protein kinase A , exchange protein directly activated by cAMP , phosphodiesterase , phosphatidylinositol 3 - Kinase , extracellular signal - regulated kinase . Most recently , we found that the EP4 receptor could increase the expression of JNK [ 16 ] , which has been found to play a pivotal role in activating transcription factors ( including c - Jun ) that increase cellular growth and tumor formation in NSCLC cells . We also showed that activation of PI3 - K , PKA , and JNK induced by EP4 was involved in the effect of PGE 2 on c - jun in NSCLC [ 46 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
