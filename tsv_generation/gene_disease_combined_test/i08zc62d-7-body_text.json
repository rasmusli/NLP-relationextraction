In order to understand how natural geranylated flavonoids interact with sialidase , we determined the crystal structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic domain ( NanI CD ; residues 243 - 694 ) in complex with diplacone at 1 . 9 \u00c5 resolution . The structural information on Cp - NanI CD and comparison with the models of human sialidases provide an insight into how the natural geranylated flavonoids can behave as antibiotics and led to the elucidation of a strategy for the design of advanced inhibitors for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by C . perfringens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 60}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
