The NS5 - E218A point mutation abolishes 2 \u2032 - O - methyltransferase activity , which functions to methylate the 5 \u2032 cap of viral RNA and facilitate escape of IFN - induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats ( IFIT ) - mediated suppression ; thus , this attenuation limits viral replication by increasing sensitivity of the virus to type I IFN - mediated innate immune mechanisms [ 45 , 49 ] . Despite this attenuation , mice treated with PLX5622 were significantly more susceptible to lethal WNV - NS5 - E218A infection than those receiving control chow ( Fig . 3a ) . Weight loss was also significantly increased in PLX5622 - treated mice ( Fig . 3b ) . Consistent with this , viral titers measured by plaque assay at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi in the olfactory bulb ( Fig . 3d ) , cortex ( Fig . 3e ) , cerebellum ( Fig . 3f ) , brainstem ( Fig . 3g ) , and spinal cord ( Fig . 3h ) were significantly higher in PLX5622 - treated compared in control - treated mice infected with WNV - NS5 - E218A . As virus was inoculated into the cortex , it was detected there at 2 dpi , followed by spread to the olfactory bulb by 4 dpi , and cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord by 6 dpi . PLX5622 treatment also led to decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in the cortex at 8 dpi ( Fig . 3c ) and increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum at 6 dpi ( Fig . 3l - p ) after i . c . infection with WNV - NS5 - E218A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
