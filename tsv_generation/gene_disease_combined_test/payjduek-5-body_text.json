In addition , the clinical finding of BCG reactivation is regarded to be highly specific for KD , as it is very rarely described in other febrile illnesses or infections . For example , in a study of febrile Japanese children aged < 2 years admitted over an 8month period with diagnoses other than KD , no BCG reactivations were observed [ 8 ] . In contrast , data from a Japanese nationwide epidemiologic survey showed that > 70 % of children in this age group who were diagnosed with KD developed BCG reactivation [ 8 ] . Measles infection has not been reported to cause BCG reactivation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 190}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
