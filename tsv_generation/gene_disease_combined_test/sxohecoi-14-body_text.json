Consistent with other investigations of Fc - FcRn interactions , maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5 . 5 - 6 . 0 , with some enhanced transcytosis apparent at pH 4 . 5 and 6 . 5 ( Figure S3H ) [ 38 , 39 ] . Since FcRn binds to IgG and not to IgA , we compared two different IgG1 mAbs , b12 and HGN194 , with their IgA class - switched versions . Both IgG1 mAbs enhanced transcytosis of HIV - 1 JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV 1157ipEL - p at pH 6 . 0 , whereas the IgA class - switched versions did not ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . In fact , as reported , dimeric IgA1 HGN194 inhibited transcytosis [ 40 ] . Thus , enhanced transcytosis at low pH in the presence of specific antibody is mediated by IgG and is dependent on FcRn .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
