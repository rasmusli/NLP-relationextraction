[ 58 ] , we use a two sided permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the observed performance differences between two methods . The test proceeds as follows , given a data set and two structure prediction procedures , A and B . First , we calculate the difference mean ( f A ) \u2212 mean ( f B ) in means http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 between sets of F - measure values obtained by A and B . Then we combine the two sets f A and f B and record the difference in sample means for 10 4 randomly chosen ways of choosing two sets with the same size as | f A | and | f B | from the combined set . The p - value is the proportion of the sampled permutations where the absolute difference was greater than or equal to that of absolute difference of the means of sets f A and f B . Then , if the p - value of this test is less than the 5 % significance level , we reject the null hypothesis that methods A and B have equal accuracy and thus accept the alternative hypothesis that the difference in accuracy of method A and B is significant . Otherwise , we cannot reject the null hypothesis . All calculations are performed using the \" perm \" package of the R statistics software environment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
