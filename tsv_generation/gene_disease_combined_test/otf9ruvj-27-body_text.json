Therefore , IVIG treatment could be a logical requirement in these patients . We included IVIG therapy in our ARDS patients based on these considerations , although we did not measure immunoglobulin levels before treatment . Indeed , in a recent retrospective analysis of 543 patients , high IgG levels were associated with high mortality in sepsis patients [ 18 ] . PCR analysis showed an early molecular response to IgM in the blood of patients with sepsis [ 19 ] . IgM levels remain low in non - surviving sepsis patients , whereas IgM levels increase transiently in surviving patients [ 20 ] . Single studies and metaanalyses have shown beneficial effects of IVIG therapy in patients with sepsis [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . However , IVIG treatment remains controversial . Randomized studies have not shown any beneficial effect of this intervention in patients with sepsis or sepsis - associated conditions [ 8 ] . Therefore , IVIG therapy is not currently recommended in the latest sepsis guidelines [ 24 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 104}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
