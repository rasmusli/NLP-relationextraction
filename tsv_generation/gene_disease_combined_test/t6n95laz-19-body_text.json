The purpose of this was to specifically identify one or more proteins that are able serve as biomarkers for predicting a pathogenic condition and for prognostic purposes , similar to \u03b1 - fetoprotein ( AFP ) for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . It was not possible in this study to obtain a series of serum samples from individual patients as they progressed through the various stages of hepatitis B infection to severe liver damage ( ACLF ) . However , using iTRAQ and western blotting , several candidate proteins were identified ( namely apolipoprotein J precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and VN ) that warrant further study using a larger number of samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 391}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
