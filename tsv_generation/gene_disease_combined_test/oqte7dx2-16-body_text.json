( 2015 ) showed that knock - down of mammalian USP46 has a greater effect on reducing surface GluA1 ( 42 % decrease ) and mEPSC amplitude ( 32 % decrease ) than overexpression of USP46 ( 18 % - 20 % increase in surface GluA1 and mEPSC amplitudes ; Huo et al . , 2015 ) . The more modest effects of USP46 overexpression are consistent with the low intrinsic catalytic activity of USP46 in the absence of WDR48 and WDR20 ( Cohn et al . , 2009 ; Faesen et al . , 2011 ) . Intriguingly , Huo et al . ( 2015 ) also showed that mammalian USP46 , but not USP12 , was able to regulate GluA1 in neurons . It will be interesting to determine how USP46 and USP12 achieve substrate specificity in vivo given that they can both interact with WDR48 and WDR20 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 81}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
