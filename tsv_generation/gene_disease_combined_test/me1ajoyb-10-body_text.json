While some of these assays are IgG - specific , others use antiserum to whole IgG , including the light chains . Since light chains are shared by all immunoglobulins , these detection antibodies are not IgG - specific . Moreover , no assays are in place for detecting IgA , which should be prominent in mucosal infections . IgM assays have been problematic despite the availability of anti - IgM capture antisera that are cross - reactive with IgM from at least one hantavirus reservoir species [ 44 ] . Some immunoglobulins have isotypes with specific effector activities , such as complement fixation or antibody - dependent cell cytotoxicity . Laboratory house mice have four IgG isotypes ; IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b and IgG3 . It is likely that reservoirs also have immunoglobulin isotypes with distinct effector functions and which might predominate during hantavirus infections . These reagent deficiencies are a current obstacle for assessing antibody responses in rodent reservoir hosts . Despite these limitations , many field studies have been conducted examining antibody responses in natural and semi - natural hantavirus infections of rodent reservoirs [ 34 , [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
