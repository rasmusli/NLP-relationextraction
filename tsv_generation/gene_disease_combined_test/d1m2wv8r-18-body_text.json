These pathways are involved in processes of cell cycle regulation , cytoskeleton remodelling , cell apoptosis and survival , oxidative phosphorylation , and immune response . Notably , eight DEPs were enriched in the pathway involved in the \" CFTR folding and maturation \" with a p - value of 9 . 398E - 06 ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . The detailed analysis depicted in Fig . 6 indicates that eight DEPs were directly or indirectly associated with the CFTR ( Derlin 1 , AMFR , HSP70 , HSP90 , Hdi - 2 , UBE1 , BAG - 2 , and SAE1 ) . Among them , Derlin 1 and AMFR were up - regulated during infection , which can directly degrade the abnormal CFTR 35 , 36 . iTRAQ - MS data were verified by western blotting . The verification of DEPs by western blotting was limited by the availability of antibodies to Felis catus proteins . Initial tests selected a set of proteins that were significantly changed during infection and also reliably cross - reacted with antibodies to the corresponding human protein . As shown in Fig . 7 , the western blots confirmed the differential expression of ribosomal protein S4X ( RPS4X ) , 60S ribosomal protein L7 ( RPL7 ) , guanine nucleotide - binding protein - like 3 - like protein ( GNL3L ) , laminin subunit gamma - 1 ( LAMC1 ) , histone H3 . 1 ( H3 . 1 ) , 60S ribosomal protein L17 ( RPL17 ) , and 60S ribosomal protein L10 ( RPL10 or QM ) detected by iTRAQ .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
