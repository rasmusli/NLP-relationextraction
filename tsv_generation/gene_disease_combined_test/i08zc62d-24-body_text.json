Because diplacone has a flavanone backbone , structural information on the Cp - NanI - diplacone complex would help in the discovery of viral neuraminidase inhibitors . In this light , we compared the structure of the Cp - NanI CD - diplacone complex with two structures of drug - resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases ( the I223R mutant of H1N1 and the H274Y mutant of H5N1 ) to examine the use of diplacone against influenza viral neuraminidases . Despite the low sequence identity and low homology of viral neuraminidases from influenza A ( IA - NA ) and B ( IB - NA ) with Cp - NanI CD ( identity : IA - NA , 11 . 56 % ; IB - NA , 12 . 55 % ; homology : IA - NA , 29 . 15 % ; IB - NA , 29 . 53 % ) , their overall structures are well conserved ( Supplementary Figs . S1 and S7a ) . Moreover , diplacone seems to be accessible regardless of the I223R or the H275Y mutation . The hydroxyl group at the C4 position of diplacone is able to interact with Glu276 of the H275Y mutant as in the wild type , which suggests that diplacone may be a potential lead compound for the development of inhibitors of drug - resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases ( Supplementary Fig . S7b ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 67}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
