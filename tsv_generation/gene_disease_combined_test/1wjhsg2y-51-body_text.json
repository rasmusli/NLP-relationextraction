Therefore , whether the aim of a network is to bolster relationships between already - connected members or foster new relationships with novel or unfamiliar actors , a network ' s structure and long - term sustainability are dependent on clear and consistent communication [ 21 , 146 ] . Several ways to ensure such communication include : participating in scientific conferences , hosting regular workshops , and creating social media and other communication platforms that allow for direct dialogue and information sharing . Scientific conferences , whether domestic or international , act as centers of learning and networking . Individuals can discover new and exciting research paths , present on shared research , and identify new network members . Workshops bring together individuals from disparate fields and provide a space for networking , data sharing , and collaboration to effectively address research gaps within a network ' s scope . For example , Fair et al . [ 146 ] used a systems dynamic model to show that a single 2 - week bat - borne surveillance workshop held in 2014 led to a massive interconnected network of scientific relationships and output , which included WAB - Net members . The WAB - Net currently organizes a collaborative workshop held in a different country in Western Asia each year , bringing together bat biologists , virologists , public health officials , and other relevant professionals . The first workshop was held in Tbilisi , Georgia , from 17 - 20 September 2018 , and included 39 workshop participants from 14 countries , of which 21 participants were from 10 countries in Western Asia . Finally , websites and social media accounts can facilitate information sharing and discussion among research teams , and provide the public with information about the network , its members , and ongoing research plans [ 21 , 151 ] . A dedicated WAB - Net website ( www . wabnet . org ) is in development to provide essential information to its members and the broader scientific community .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1406, "end": 1416}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
