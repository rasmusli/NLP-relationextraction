In eukaryotic cells , polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription , translation , and DNA replication , and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation . Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood . Picornaviruses , including Coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) , are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo ; however , precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described . Here , we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine - depleted conditions . We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases , and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion . Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity , we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity . We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine - depleted conditions . Finally , we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine - depleted cells . In sum , our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection . Further , these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine - depleting antiviral therapies . Viral proteases play many roles during infection , and picornaviruses encode two distinct proteases : 2A ( 2A pro ) and 3C ( 3C pro ) . The 2A and 3C picornaviral proteases function to cleave both host and viral proteins . 3C is responsible for the majority of viral polyprotein cleavage . Importantly , 3C also functions as part of 3CD ( a polyprotein consisting of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase ) and acts as a protease in this context as well [ 11 ] . To date , reports demonstrated that 2A facilitates the cleavage between the P1 and P2 protein segments [ 12 ] . The precise regulation of these proteases , their activities , and their overlapping and unique functions remains to be fully understood . However , due to their copious functions during infection , they represent potential drug targets [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 780}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
