A majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern ( 77 % ) , and 9 % of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status ( Figure 4a ) . Yet , population trends for most bat species in Western Asia , including those classified as \" least concern , \" are largely unknown or decreasing ( Figure 4b ) , and additional research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation .
