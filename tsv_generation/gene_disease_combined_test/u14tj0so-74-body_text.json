[ 47 ] is a heuristic algorithm for prediction of pseudoknotted structures . This method incorporates SHAPE reactivity data as a pseudo energy term into the prediction method . SHAPE reactivity data is only available for a limited number of RNA sequences , so we cannot compare Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots on our data set . Therefore , we use data set of Hajdin et al . to compare these two methods . In their data set Hajdin et al . have 18 RNA sequences in their training set and 6 RNA sequences in their test set . We run Iterative HFold with hotspots for each RNA sequence and choose the lowest http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 energy structure as the final output of our program . For Shapeknots , we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al . [ 47 ] to compare with Iterative HFold . Table 5 shows the results of this comparison . In all but one sequence of the test set , Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than ShapeKnots . The exception is the HIV - 1 5 ' pseudoknot domain ; Hajdin et al . note that the accepted structure of HIV - 1 5 ' pseudoknot domain is based on a SHAPE directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between ShapeKnots and Iterative HFold may be biased towards ShapeKnots . In the training set , however , Iterative HFold does not perform as well as ShapeKnots . This might be because parameters of ShapeKnots were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy . Since both the training and test data sets are small , we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 170}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
