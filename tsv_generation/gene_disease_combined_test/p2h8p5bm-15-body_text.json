The envelope carries two surface proteins , the envelope ( E ) protein and the membrane ( M ) protein . The latter is derived from a precursor protein , prM . The nucleocapsid ( NC ) lies inside the viral envelope and consists of multiple copies of capsid ( C ) protein and the viral genome . The TBFV genomes are single stranded , positive - sense RNA of approximately 11 , 000 nucleotides . It has a 5 - cap with a single open reading frame ( ORF ) . The ORF is flanked by 5 and 3 untranslated regions ( UTRs ) . The viral protein is encoded by the ORF as a single polyprotein , which is co - and post - translationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into individual viral proteins ( three structural and seven non - structural ) . The polyprotein is arranged in the order 5 - C - prM - E - NS1 - NS2A - NS2B - NS3 - NS4A - NS4B - NS5 - 3 [ 70 , 71 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 97}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
