Infected farms recover after a period T and cannot be reinfected . We aim to investigate spread of relatively ' fast - moving ' diseases in the absence of movement restrictions such as FMD . We make the assumption that transmission of infection to a farm results in all animals on that farm moving into the infectious class . Given this assumption , the risk of infection between any pair of nodes in the movement network is based upon the number of movements between them rather than the number of animals moved . In order to investigate the impact of epidemiological parameters upon model predictions , we explore a range of values for the transmission parameter and the infectious period , such that b \u00bc 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and T \u00bc 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 days .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
