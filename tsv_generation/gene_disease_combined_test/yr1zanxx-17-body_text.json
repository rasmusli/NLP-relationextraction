Consistent with published data [ 8 , 49 ] , 30 % of control - treated mice survived infection with 10 4 PFU and 90 % of control - treated mice survived infection with 10 2 PFU ; however , mice treated with PLX5622 universally succumbed to infection with either inoculum titer ( Fig . 2a ) . This was associated with significantly increased weight loss ( Fig . 2b ) and more severe clinical score ( Fig . 2c , d ) in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU WNV - NY .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
