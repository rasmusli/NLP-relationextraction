The Sapling Server allows direct queries against the database ; however , a set of common data requests is implemented as direct server functions . Sapling Server functions typically accept multiple input values within a single call , allowing a client to minimize the number of requests that must be made to the server . Additional input parameters allow a client to modify the query , for example , to request that the output be in FASTA format or to ask for protein rather than DNA sequences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 101}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
