The amount and accuracy of annotation in sequence databases vary markedly between entries that has been a major concern for the bioinformatics community continuously working toward improving this critical aspect of sequence databases [ 7 , 8 , 27 ] . Involving other researchers in this effort , especially those who submit original sequence annotation in the first place , could accelerate the process . We hope that through using SNAD service , researchers could see immediate benefits from better annotation for their research that may create impetus for contributing quality annotation to public databases . To improve the user experience with SNAD , we plan to expand the diversity of databases and templates upon future upgrades of SNAD . Any template that the users designed and considered useful could be included in the future SNAD releases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
