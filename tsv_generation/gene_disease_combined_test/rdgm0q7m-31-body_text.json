In the best characterized system , poliovirus , the capacity of PCBPs to associate at two discrete genomic RNA locations and in concert with different protein partners is critical to almost all aspects of the virus replication cycle ( reviewed in Ref . 57 ) . Whether such complex regulatory circuits operate during PRRSV replication and transcription remains to be determined . PCBP2 has been shown to associate with the 5 untranslated region of the PRRSV genome and may be involved in genome replication or translation initiation ( 34 , 35 ) . Furthermore , the relative abundance and location of PCBPs in the cytoplasm of infected cells could be important in determining the precise ratio of non - frameshifted ( full - length nsp2 ) and trans - frame ( nsp2TF , nsp2N ) products at various stages of the replication cycle .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
