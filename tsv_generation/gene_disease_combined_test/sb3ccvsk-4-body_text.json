Incomplete DT - mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion in naive adult DEREG mice is advantageous to our studies as it enables a window to study effects of Foxp3 + Treg ablation on myelin reactive CD4 + T cells without confounding complications of lymphoproliferative disease and systemic lethal autoimmunity ( 23 , 24 ) . DT treatment of JHMV - infected DEREG mice at the peak of SR T cell CNS infiltration ( between days 21 and 28 post infection ) , resulted in increased lymphocyte expansion and T cell activation in CLN , coincident with elevated pro - inflammatory cytokine expression compared to DT - treated controls . More importantly , Foxp3 + Treg ablation specifically increased frequencies of myelin - specific but not virus - specific CD4 + T cells , indicating preferential regulation of peripheral SR T cells by Foxp3 + Tregs . Surprisingly however , CNS inflammation , viral persistence , and demyelination remained similar consistent with no changes in virus and myelin - specific CD4 + T cells within the CNS . The apparent redundant role of Foxp3 + Tregs in regulating CNS inflammation implied a potential protective function of Tr1 cells . Analysis of SR T cells during chronic JHMV infection of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice , which lack Tr1 cells , revealed no effects within the CLN . By contrast , both virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells were increased within the CNS of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 relative to wild - type ( WT ) mice . Altogether , these data indicate differential regulation of SR CD4 + T cells within the CLN versus CNS during chronic JHMV infection . While Foxp3 + Tregs specifically control myelinspecific CD4 + T cells within CLN , Tr1 cells limit SR T cells within the CNS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 20}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
