F4 - positive and F18 ETEC ( ETEC : F4 and ETEC : F18 ) strains represent the major cause of PWD in pigs . F4 are flexible fimbriae that occur as the F4ab , F4ac , or F4ad variant , the F4ac variant being by far the most important type encountered in PWD [ 50 ] . The F4 fimbriae mediate bacterial attachment to F4 receptors ( F4R ) , present on the small intestinal brush borders of villous enterocytes allowing ETEC to survive and persist in the small intestine and cause diarrhea [ 51 ] . Thus , attachment of ETEC to the pig intestinal mucosa is a crucial step in the pathogenesis and the initiation of PWD . Two antigenic variants of F18 fimbriae exist : F18ab ( F107 ) and F18ac ( 2134P and 8813 ) . F18ac is commonly associated with ETEC causing PWD , whereas F18ab is often involved in oedema disease [ 52 ] . No cross protection between F18ab and F18ac was observed on vaccination against F18 variants [ 53 ] . A nonfimbrial adhesin identified as AIDA ( adhesin involved in diffuse adherence ) has been observed to be associated with ETEC strains recovered from pigs with PWD [ 54 ] . In this study , 50 . 0 % of isolates were ETEC - aidA + . Moreover , it has been demonstrated that the expression of AIDA by a diarrheagenic E . coli strain ( AIDA - I + , STb + ) was essential for pig ' s intestinal colonization and for in vitro bacterial autoaggregation and biofilm formation [ 55 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
