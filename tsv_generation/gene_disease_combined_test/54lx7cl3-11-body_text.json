Streptococcus pneumoniae , the leading cause of pneumonia [ 39 ] , is characterized by over 90 serotypes differentiated by variations in the bacterial polysaccharide capsule [ 40 , 41 ] and associated with different propensities of invasive potential [ 42 ] . In addition to protecting against phagocytosis , the capsule prevents clearance by mucous secretion and restricts autolysis [ 43 ] . Other species , including S . aureus , release anti - opsonizing proteins and possess surface protein A to evade phagocytosis . Furthermore , S . aureus secretes leukotoxins that lyse leukocytes and express superantigens that hinder immune response ( reviewed by Naber et al . [ 44 ] ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 336}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
