First , feline PBMCs significantly proliferated in presence of ODN 2216 , indicating a direct and / or indirect stimulation of one or more immune cell subpopulations by this molecule . Although in contrast to other classes of ODN CpG - A does not generally induce lymphocyte proliferation in mice [ 12 ] , similar effects have previously been observed in ovine cells , where higher concentrations of CpG - A could induce minimal levels of proliferation [ 68 ] . Additionally , ODN 2216 increased the expression of cell surface co - stimulatory molecules in PBMCs , reinforcing possible interactions between various immune cell populations in subsequent specific responses . While B7 . 1 molecules were upregulated on both lymphocytic and non - lymphocytic cells after ODN 2216 stimulation , MHCII expression could only be increased on lymphocytic cells . This observation may be linked to the time point of our measurements , or to the necessity of transport to the cell surface of MHCII molecules coupled with antigen for presentation to other immune cells . Finally , the transcription of a series of markers of innate immune responses was considerably influenced in feline PBMCs by stimulation with ODN 2216 . The most astonishing effects of this molecule thereby remain the potent induction of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03c9 , with mRNA expression of these genes increased by up to 12 000 and 35 000 - fold respectively in PBMCs of certain animals . In line with observations published recently , the induction of IFN\u03b3 by this CpG ODN remained moderate [ 34 ] ; nevertheless , the measurements carried out 24 h after stimulation of purified feline cells support induction of Th1 - oriented immune responses and enhanced NK cell activity , both highly desired in the contexts of viral infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 341}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
