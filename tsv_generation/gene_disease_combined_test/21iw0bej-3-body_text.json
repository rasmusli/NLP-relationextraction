It was first isolated from samples obtained in California in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis ( Schieble et al . , 1967 ) . Over the past 10 years , EV - D68 infection outbreaks have been reported in Italy , the United States , Germany , China , and several other countries ( Esposito et al . , 2015 ; Farrell et al . , 2015 ; Reiche et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) , with a record number of confirmed cases in 2014 ( http : / / www . cdc . gov / non - polio - enterovirus / about / ev - d68 . html ) . Unfortunately , no vaccines for prevention or medicines for treatment are currently available for future outbreaks , mainly due to the fact that information on host factors required for EV - D68 replication is scarce . EV - D68 belong to enterovirus ( family Picornaviridae , genus Enterovirus ) , which are non - enveloped , positive - sense singlestrand RNA viruses of approximately 7500 nt and contain a large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved to yield corresponding viral proteins . Based on the molecular and biological characteristics , four human enterovirus ( HEV ) species are currently designated as HEV - A , - B , - C , and - D ( Oberste et al . , 1999a , b ) . The representative of HEV - A serotype is human enterovirus 71 ( EV - A71 ) , which is a primary causative agent for Hand , foot , and mouth disease ( HFMD ) that is associated with the recent outbreaks in Asia ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ) . EV - D68 is assigned to HEV - D serotype , but EV - D68 is unlike other enteroviruses in that it is acid labile and biologically more similar to human rhinoviruses that are associated with respiratory diseases ( Smura et al . , 2010 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 880}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
