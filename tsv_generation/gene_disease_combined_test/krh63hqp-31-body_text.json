In certain sites of the HA1 genomic segment of H3 , non - synonymous substitutions occur at more than twice the rate as in other sites [ 39 ] . This is seen as a major signature of adaptive change , but deleterious mutations in the areas not under selection are carried along with the ones under positive selection [ 36 ] . In this light , some perceive H1N1 to be a growing threat , with a new outbreak being just a matter of time . Despite this common perception , a more lethal version of H1N1 has not arisen via mutation within the human population during the last 90 + years . This is significant . The two major human influenza pandemics since 1918 did not arise due to mutations within H1N1 , but arose via horizontal transmission of new genetic material from bird influenza strains , creating recombinant viruses . They were also less lethal than the 1918 version . It is true that the population had a degree of residual immunity and was not as immunologically na\u00efve as it was in 1917 - 18 , but selection has still not been able to generate a devastating pandemic from the remnants of that which swept the world at the close of WWI .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 29}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
