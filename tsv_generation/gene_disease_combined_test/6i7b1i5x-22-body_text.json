Cytokines , such as IFN - \u03b3 , IL - 1 and TNF , that would be present during generalized inflammation , facilitate a pathological anti - endothelial response of circulating IgG and IgM antibodies associated with acute KD [ 125 , 126 ] . In cell lysis assays , pathogenesis was eliminated by clearing the serum through anti - IgG and anti - IgM sepharose columns supportive of no role of peripheral anti - IgA responses . This does not eliminate the potential role of intra - tissue IgA + plasma cell development in pathogenesis as has been postulated [ 83 , 102 ] . Other studies support significant IgM mediated cytotoxicity against endothelial cells in KD patients [ 127 ] . Prevalent IgM anti - endothelial responses in KD have also been shown without cytokine stimulation [ 127 , 128 ] . In a mouse model system , anti - endothelial antibody responses were replicated , but these did not demonstrate cardiac vascular involvement [ 129 ] . The case report of anti - B cell monoclonal antibody success was proposed by the authors to be due to the downregulation of such an anti - endothelial invasive effect [ 63 ] . Although intriguing , it remains unknown if these anti - endothelial responses actually contribute to the vasculitis in KD and other vasculitides [ 123 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
