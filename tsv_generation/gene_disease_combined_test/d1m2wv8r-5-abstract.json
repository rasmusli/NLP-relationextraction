CPV infection causes high fatality in neonatal animals and severe haemorrhagic enteritis in adult dogs 7 . It is introduced by faecal - oral transmission , and it initially infects and replicates in the rapidly dividing cells of lymphoid tissues , intestinal crypt epithelial cells , and precursor cells in the bone marrow . Severe haemorrhagic enteritis increases the risk for viral translocation and coliform septicaemia , leading to septic shock and ultimately death 8 . CPV infects cells by binding to the transferrin receptor 9 , and CPV pathogenicity is thought to be caused by the non - structural proteins of parvoviruses 10 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 615, "end": 638}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
