Therefore , and based on their mode of action , the antioxidants can be classified as primary , secondary or co - antioxidants . Primary antioxidants are able to donate a hydrogen atom rapidly to a lipid radical , forming a new radical , which is more stable . Secondary antioxidants react with the initiating radicals ( or inhibit the initiating enzymes ) , or reduce the oxygen level ( without generating reactive radical species ) . Therefore , these secondary antioxidants can retard the rate of radical initiation reaction by elimination of initiators . This can be performed by deactivating high energy species ( singlet oxygen ) ; absorbing UV light ; scavenging of oxygen ; chelating metal that catalyses free radical reaction , or inhibiting enzymes , such as peroxidases , NADPH oxidase , xanthine oxidase , among other oxidative enzymes [ 28 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 331}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
