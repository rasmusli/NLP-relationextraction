Independent studies have shown that Zika virus activates autophagy and that the formation of autophagosomes is crucial to the replication of the virus . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] It appears that the nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B are responsible for the induction of autophagy in infected cells by inhibiting the AKT - MTOR signaling , and both of them contain 3 WxxL motifs . 80 , 82 Very little is known about the relation between Zika virus infection and autophagy modulation . We have found several proteins encoded by Zika genome polyprotein that contain LIR motifs , that could be good candidates for experimental validation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
