In addition to considering two geographic discretizations of the available data , we also identify community structure in global air travel by determining partitions with high intracommunity connectivity and low inter - community connectivity ( Methods ) . Although this approach is blind to the airports ' geographic locations , the 14 resulting global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions ( Fig . 1 ) . We find air communities that are largely specific to Oceania , China , Japan , Sub - Saharan Africa , Mexico and Canada . Madagascar , R\u00e9union and some Caribbean destinations are examples of exceptions that are , as non - European locations , connected to a European air community .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
