However , reports , from prospective conducted studies without profound characterisation of the isolates , describing association between wheezing and bacterial infection support our findings [ 10 , 19 , 22 ] . The absence of a control group is considered a minor weakness , as previous publications have demonstrated the limited risk for contamination of BAL when technical precautions are taken [ 13 , 20 , 26 , 27 ] . Moreover , performance of FOB + BAL is considered unethical in healthy children [ 10 , 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
