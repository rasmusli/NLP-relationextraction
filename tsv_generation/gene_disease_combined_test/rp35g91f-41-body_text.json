ACTC1 was selected as its transcript was highly expressed in the lung data set ( 12 . 422 units ) and was part of n our pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network ( Table S3 in File S2 ) . Further , Actc1 has previously been shown to be a direct target of NKX2 - 5 ( Chen et al . 1996 ) . To differentiate between the pulmonary myocardium and typical smooth muscle , we also examined the localization of ACTA2 . Cardiac ventricular tissue was used as a positive control for cardiomyocyte ( TNNI3 and ACTC1 ) and smooth muscle ( ACTA2 ) immunostaining ( Figure S2 in File S1 ) . Distinct cell - type localization of TNNI3 and ACTA2 was observed in lung samples from four BALB / c mice ( Figure 4 ; representative image from one mouse shown ) . A thin muscle coat staining positively for ACTA2 was situated beneath the columnar epithelium ( Figure 4A , black filled arrow ) typical of bronchi and bronchioles in BALB / c mice ( Rockx et al . 2007 ) . Consistent with previous reports describing the pulmonary vein myocardium ( Kracklauer et al . 2013 ; Mueller - Hoecker et al . 2008 ) , a thick muscle coat positively staining for TNNI3 was situated beneath a monolayer of endothelium lining the vein lumen ( Mueller - Hoecker et al . 2008 ) ( Figure 4B , white filled arrow ) . This myocardial layer also stained positively for ACTC1 ( Figure 4C , white filled arrow ) , and contained visible striations ( Figure 4C , insert with [UNK] ) previously reported to be evident in pulmonary vein myocardium ( Kracklauer et al . 2013 ; Mueller - Hoecker et al . 2008 ) . Weak staining of ACTC1 but not TNNI3 was detected in bronchial smooth muscle cells ( Figure 4 , B and C , black filled arrow ) . No positive staining was detected with an isotype control antibody ( Figure 4D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 188}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
