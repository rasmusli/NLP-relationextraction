In addition , 95 % S . pneumoniae isolates showed sensitivity to ceftriaxone and 84 % showed sensitivity to cefixime . However , a disappointing antibiotic resistance pattern for S . pneumoniae was observed for other antibiotics including erythromycin , azithromycin , and cotrimoxazole , showing resistance frequencies of 44 % , 61 % , and 89 % , respectively . The antibiotic susceptibility test data demonstrate an alarming resistance level of K . pneumaniae , showing 100 % resistance against azithromycin , 55 % resistance against each of ceftriaxone , cefixime and ciprofloxacin ; 27 % and 45 % resistance frequencies against Gentamicin and Tobramycin , respectively . Only carbapenem group of antibiotics including imipenem and meropenem had exhibited 100 % sensitivity against K . pneumaniae in vitro ( Table 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
