Future controlled experiments aimed at studying transmission dynamics in the presence and absence of stress in bats would lead to a more definitive answer . It is also important to look into various factors that might stress bats such as habitat destruction ( deforestation ) , pregnancy , change in seasons , and climate change . Additionally , the molecular mechanisms leading to the waning of antibodies and other aspects of adaptive immune response in bats are not known . A holistic picture of bat immune systems and the factors leading to an increase in viral replication might help us further understand viral spillovers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
