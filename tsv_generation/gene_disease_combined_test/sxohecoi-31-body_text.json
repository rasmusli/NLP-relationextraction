Subjects from whom specimens were collected for study purposes provided written informed consent . Antibodies HIVIG ( IgG derived from pooled plasma of HIV - infected individuals ) and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) 2F5 , 4E10 , 2G12 , F240 , b6 , and VRC01 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagents Program . IVIG ( Gamunex , Taleris Biotherapeutics ) was commercially acquired . mAb b12 and control mAb Den3 were provided by Dennis Burton and Brian Moldt , and control mAb Fm - 6 was a gift of Wayne Marasco ( Dana - Farber Cancer Institute ) ; b12 and the control mAbs are IgG1 . Generation and purification of dimeric and monomeric IgA2 versions of b12 ( dIgA2 b12 and mIgA2 b12 ) are described elsewhere [ 66 ] . Briefly , the IgG constant region in pDR . 12 ( IgG b12 ) was replaced with the constant region of IgA2 . IgA2 b12 was expressed in CHO - K1 cells with human J chain and purified by Protein L affinity matrix ( Pierce ) . mIgA b12 and dIgA b12 were isolated by size exclusion chromatography . IgG1 HGN194 ( a human mAb against HIV - 1 Env V3 ) , dIgA1 HGN194 , and dIgA2HGN194 were provided by Davide Corti and Antonio Lanzavecchia [ 67 ] . HGN194 variants were constructed as follows : human J chain precursor ( accession number NP _ 653247 ) , IgA1 ( allele IGHA1 * 01 , accession number J00220 ) and IgA2 ( allele IGHA2 * 01 , accession number J00221 ) constant region nucleotide sequences were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript . Constant regions were cloned into a mammalian expression vector used for subcloning of the HGN19 VH region . The HGN194 VH and VL chain were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned into an IgG1 and Ig - lambda expression vector . MAbs HGN194 dIgA1 , dIgA2 , and IgG1 were produced by transient transfection of 293 freestyle cells with polyethylenimine and expression plasmids encoding corresponding heavy and light chains ( in the case of dIgA1 and dIgA2 , the J chain expression plasmid was included ) . Supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7 - 10 days of culture . HGN194 dIgA1 , dIgA2 , and IgG1 were affinity purified by Peptide M ( dIgA1 and dIgA2 ) or Protein A ( IgG1 ) chromatography . Purified Abs were quantified by ELISA using dIgA1 and dIgA2 or IgG1 - specific Abs ( Southern Biotech ) . Purity and polymeric state of dIgA1 and dIgA2 were confirmed by native - PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography . The presence of dIgA1 and dIgA2 associated J - chain was confirmed by Western blot from native and SDS - PAGE gels . Sera from 20 Zambian clade C - infected subjects ( obtained from Zdenek Hel , University of Alabama , Birmingham ) were pooled for IgG isolation using the Pierce Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Env - specific IgG , determined as for CVL and seminal fluid ( see below ) , was 0 . 98 % of total IgG . Sera from five uninfected individuals were pooled and processed for IgG isolation in the same manner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 286}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
