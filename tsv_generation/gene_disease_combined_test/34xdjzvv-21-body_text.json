The animal - use protocols were reviewed and approved by the NHRI Institutional Figure 6 . N3 inhibited viral loads of the tissues from hSCARB2 - transgenic mice preinfected with EV71 5746 . 7 - day old hSCARB2transgenic mice were challenged with 1610 5 pfu of 5746 and followed by receiving 200 mg N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post infection . Infected mice received no antibody were included . On day 6 post infection , mice were sacrificed and RNAs were extracted from the brainstem , spinal cord , muscle , skin , and intestine for quantitative RT - PCR using primers specific to VP1 region of P1 transcripts . Virus copy numbers were calculated using a standard curve shown by purified EV71 . A schematic representation of the virus copy number and the statistical average from 11 mice per group is shown . The unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0069858 . g006", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 491}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
