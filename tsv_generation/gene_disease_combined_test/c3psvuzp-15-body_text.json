Strikingly , these three genes encode the only three human proteins that contain both a PARP catalytic domain and macrodomains , and are the only human genes to encode more than one macrodomain . The macrodomain is unique among protein domains in its ability to recognize mono - ADP - ribosylated proteins [ 47 ] . Furthermore , some macrodomains have recently been shown to catalyze the removal of mono - ADPr [ 15 , 16 ] . Although the molecular functions of macro - PARPs are unclear , the presence of both PARP domains and macrodomains may conceivably allow them to both add and specifically recognize and / or reverse protein ADP - ribosylation . This , combined with the presence of macrodomains in viruses , prompted us to explore in more depth the evolution of other human macrodomain - containing proteins and ADP - ribosylhydrolases . Apart from the macro - PARPs , we found no evidence for positive selection in any other human gene encoding a macrodomain or ADP - ribosylhydrolase ( Figure S3 ) , suggesting that the combination of the macro - and PARP domains is important for their rapid evolution and , consequently , for their putative antiviral roles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
