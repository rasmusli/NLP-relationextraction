In NEC cultures , JEV induced limited cell death , visualized as increased membrane permeability ( dark blue in Fig . 3A ) . This cell death was at least partially mediated by apoptosis since cleaved caspase 3 was detected in the infected cultures ( red in Fig . 3B ) . Relating to the higher rate of infection , the Laos strain induced more cell death than the Nakayama strain .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
