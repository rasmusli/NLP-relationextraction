Though the detection and quantification of GMO proteins using immunoassay has been reported [ 1 ] , denaturation of the protein during processing makes the method unsuitable for GMO testing and quantification of food . The durability of DNA makes it a better substrate for testing and its amplification by PCR is the method of choice , as recommended by the EC ( 2004 / 787 ) , for detection and quantification of GMO in samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
