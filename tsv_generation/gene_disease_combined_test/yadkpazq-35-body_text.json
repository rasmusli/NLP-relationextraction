This is most likely the result of the more time consuming and costly manufacturing process of these molecules linked to the synthesis of the flanking poly ( G ) strings necessary for optimal immune effects [ 31 ] . Also , CpG - A exhibit only weak stimulation of B cells , which produce antibodies that are valuable in later antiviral responses . Stability of CpG - A in vivo has also been questioned due to the only partial phosphorothioate backbone of these molecules . This can be partially compensated however , by the formation , through association of their poly ( G ) stretches , of highly ordered Gtetrad structures with enhanced stability [ 12 ] . Their smaller content in synthetic backbones could moreover help reduce possible long - term side effects [ 79 , 80 ] . Most importantly , CpG - A remain the most potent inducers of type I IFN , themselves the most biologically active antiviral molecules known to date [ 19 ] . With regard to this , a recombinant feline type I IFN marketed in both Japan ( Intercat \u00ae ) and Europe ( Virbagen Omega \u00ae ) has made its way into therapeutic protocols for FCV , FHV , FeLV and canine parvovirus infections [ 67 , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] and has demonstrated preventive capacities in a cattery developing an outbreak of FPV [ 87 ] . However , when compared to direct initiation of antiviral mechanisms by a recombinant IFN\u03b1 protein , administration of CpG ODN holds the advantage of inducing the production of all type I IFN and their subtypes , which have been shown to possess differential antiviral properties and kinetics [ 88 ] . Our data demonstrate that five viral species belonging to the Calicivirus , Herpesvirus , Parvovirus , Coronavirus and Retrovirus families were highly sensitive to the immunologic effects of ODN 2216 in feline cells . Strength and breadth of antiviral defense mechanisms induced in vivo by this molecule have the potential to outweigh those observed with recombinant IFN .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
