Each of seven proteins - the core , E1 , E2 , NS3 - 4A , NS4B , NS5A , and NS5B - was recognized and labeled by a separate cognate antibody directed ( Figure S3 ) . To induce effective immune responses against HCV proteins in transgenic mice , we injected an rVV - HCV ( rVV - CN2 , rVV - CN5 , or rVV - N25 ) or LC16m8 ( as the control ) intradermally into CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice 90 days after poly ( I : C ) injection ( Figure 2B ) . Analysis of liver sections 7 days after immunization with rVV - N25 revealed dramatic improvement in a variety of pathological findings associated with chronic hepatitis - including piecemeal necrosis , hepatocyte swelling , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , abnormal accumulation of glycogen , and steatosis ( Figures 2C - E ) . Collectively , these results demonstrated that only the rVV - N25 treatment resulted in histological changes indicative of improvement in the chronic hepatitis suffered by the transgenic mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
