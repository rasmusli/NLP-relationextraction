However , several studies suggest that bacteria might play a role in wheezing in young children [ 9 , 10 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] . Moreover , it is increasingly appreciated that the human body is home to an extended microbiome , with asthmatic children harbouring different bacteria and a less diverse mix compared to healthy children [ 21 ] . Characterisation of the predominant bacteria in wheezing children is essential to understand the pathophysiology of persistent wheezing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
