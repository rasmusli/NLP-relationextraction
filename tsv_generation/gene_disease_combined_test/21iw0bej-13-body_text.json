RNA was extracted from infected and uninfected cells using Trizol reagent ( Gibco - BRL , Rockville , Md . ) and isolated as specified by the manufacturer . The RNA was DNAse - treated ( DNase I - RNase - Free , Ambion ) to remove any contaminating DNA ; 200 ng of total RNA was reverse - transcribed with oligo dT primers using the High Capacity cDNA RT Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) in a 20 \u00b5l cDNA reaction , as specified by the manufacturer . For quantitative PCR , the template cDNA was added to a 20 \u00b5l reaction with SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) and 0 . 2 \u00b5M of primer ( Table 1 ) . The amplification was carried out using an ABI Prism 7000 for 40 cycles under the following conditions : initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 10 min ; 40 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 15 s and 60 \u2022 C for 1 min . The fold changes were calculated relative to GAPDH using the Ct method .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 294}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
