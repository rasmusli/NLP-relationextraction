Groups of four C57BL / 6 mice were immunised intramuscularly ( i . m . ) through electroporation - mediated delivery three times at 2 - week intervals with 25 \u03bcg of either the empty control pVax1 or the consensus ZIKV - prME vaccine plasmids . Sera was obtained from each immunized mouse and tested by ELISA for ZIKV - specific IgG responses using immobilised rZIKV - E as the capture antigen . A significant increase in anti - ZIKV - specific IgG was observed on day 21 with a further boost in the sera IgG levels noted on day 35 ( Figure 3a ) . Day 60 sera from vaccinated animals show that Figure 3 . Anti - ZIKV antibody responses are induced by ZIKV - prME vaccination . ( a ) ELISA analysis measuring binding antibody production ( measured by OD450 values ) in immunised mice . The C57BL / 6 mice ( n = 4 ) were immunised i . m . three times with 25 \u03bcg of ZIKV - prME plasmid or pVax1 at 2 - week intervals . Binding to rZIKV - E was analysed with sera from animals at different time points ( days 21 , 35 and 60 ) post immunisation at various dilutions . The data shown are representative of at least three separate experiments . ( b ) Endpoint binding titre analysis . Differences in the anti - ZIKV endpoint titres produced in response to the ZIKV - prME immunogen were analysed in sera from immunised animals after each boost . ( c ) Western blot analysis of rZIKV - E specific antibodies induced by ZIKV - prME immunisation . The rZIKV - E protein was electrophoresed on a 12 . 5 % SDS polyacrylamide gel and anal by western blot analysis with pooled sera from ZIKV - prME immunised mice ( day 35 ) . Binding to rZIKV - E is indicated by the arrowhead . ( d ) Immunofluorescence analysis of ZIKV specific antibodies induced by ZIKV - prME immunisation . The Vero cells infected with either ZIKV - MR766 or mock infected were stained with pooled sera from ZIKV - prME immunised mice ( day 35 ) followed by an anti - mouse - AF488 secondary antibody for detection . ( e ) Plaque - reduction neutralisation ( PRNT ) assay analysis of neutralising antibodies induced by ZIKV - prME immunisation . The serum samples from the ZIKV - prME immunised mice were tested for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro . PRNT 50 was defined as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50 % of the input virus . The values in parentheses indicate the PRNT 50 . Control ZIKV - Cap ( DNA vaccine expressing the ZIKV capsid protein ) and pVax1 sera were used as negative controls . ZIKV - prME , precursor membrane and Env of Zika virus . elevated ZIKV - specific antibody responses were maintained long term following the final boost . Most importantly , sera from vaccinated mice contained very high levels of rZIKV - E - specific antibodies as indicated by the endpoint titres ( Figure 3b ) . Additional assessment of the specificity of the vaccine - induced antibodies was performed by screening pooled sera from ZIKV - prME plasmid inoculated mice for its ability to detect rZIKV - E by western analysis ( Figure 3c ) and to stain ZIKV ( MR766 strain ) infected cells in an immunofluorescence assay ( Figure 3d ) . The results from both these analyses confirmed specificity of the vaccine - induced humoral responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 79}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
