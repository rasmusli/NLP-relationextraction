The expression of one of these antiviral proteins , the Mx GTPase , is known to be directly stimulated by type I IFN and can be used as marker for the induction of intracellular antiviral mechanisms by these cytokines in cats as well as in other species [ 19 , 64 ] . Thus , as detection of feline type I IFN on a protein level is rendered difficult by the unavailability of antibodies specifically recognizing these proteins , mRNA levels of Mx were measured in feline PBMCs after stimulation with ODN 2216 , as indication for production of type I IFN . Transcription of Mx was significantly enhanced and remained proportional to mRNA expression of type I IFN in stimulated PBMCs of individual cats ( Figure 4A", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
