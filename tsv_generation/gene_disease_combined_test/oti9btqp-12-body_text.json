Day 35 ( 1 week after third immunisation ) sera from pVax1 - and both non - consensus vaccine - immunised mice were analysed by ELISA for binding to rZIKV - E . This analysis indicates that both MR766 and Brazil vaccine plasmids induced significant antibody binding , and that immunisation with the consensus ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine generates an effective humoral response against rZIKV - E ( Supplementary Figure S1C , D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 108}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
