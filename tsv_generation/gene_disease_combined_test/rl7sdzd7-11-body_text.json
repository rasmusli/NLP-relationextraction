These do not form the specific banding patterns representing the different multimeric LAMP products that are characteristic for each assay and thus can be easily distinguished on a gel . Alternative banding patterns have been observed , also for low template reactions ; analyses of these products show that they are formed by interactions of the primers used [ 8 ] , to form LAMP equivalents of primer - dimers . Two factors seem to be important : in the absence of target , low background DNA may aid the formation of non - specific products that go on to be amplified ; and freeze - thaw repetitions may induce damage to the primers to permit the formation of ' primer intermediates ' which can then be amplified . Since LAMP is capable of non - specific amplification , techniques that rely on the detection of by - products of DNA synthesis , e . g . , the use of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation [ 9 ] or the use of SyBr Green dye [ 10 ] may not be able to distinguish between real and Right border sequences of MS8 and RF3 Figure 1 Right border sequences of MS8 and RF3 . Sequences of the plant ( above ) and transgene ( below ) at the right border junctions for MS8 and RF3 . Highlighted sequences are the targets of the LAMP primers . The plant sequences are those shown in Table 1 : dark blue bases highlighted are the outer displacement primers , yellow and green sequences are the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the LAMP primers respectively , and light blue sequences depict the loop primers . The sensitivity of the LAMP assay and its suitability for practical GMO detection was tested using assays for commonly - used sequence motifs , the CaMV 35S promoter ( P - 35S ) and the Agrobacterium promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene ( P - nos and T - nos , respectively ) . These sequences are commonly used in constructs used to create approved GM events ( see [ 11 ] ) . RoundUp Ready [UNK] soya construct contains both P - 35S and T - nos so provided convenient template for testing the assays . We used a sample where the copy number of the GM has been well characterized and thus control the number of template in each reaction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 106}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
