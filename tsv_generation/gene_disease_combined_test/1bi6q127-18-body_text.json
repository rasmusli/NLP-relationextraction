One such critical factor is increased shedding of virus by bats . This factor is influenced by the host response and virus replication . Plowright et al . [ 47 ] proposed a hypothesis which states that viruses infect na\u00efve susceptible bats leading to acute infection . This subsequently progresses to a chronic or latent infection . The virus then reactivates from time to time in response to a variety of physiological and environmental triggers . This hypothesis is called the SILI hypothesis : Susceptible - Infectious - Latent - Infectious [ 47 ] . As described above , the bat immune system is unique and virus infection probably persists in many bats .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
