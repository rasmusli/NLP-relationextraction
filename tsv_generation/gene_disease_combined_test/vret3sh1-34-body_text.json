The SEED also offers an alternative for creating custom interfaces , moreover , one that does not require the user to know appropriate SEED IDs . This approach exploits the conversion capabilities of the SEED for creating a program to accept arbitrary protein IDs . It also exploits the ability of SEED to map functional roles into subsystems as described in the preceding example . The result is a tool that enables the user to take a SEED ID and a region size , and extract the genes that are found within a region centered on the designated gene . The code for this example is shown at . http : / / servers . theseed . org / sapling / server . cgi ? code = server _ paper _ example3 . pl ( also provided as Supporting Information S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 9}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
