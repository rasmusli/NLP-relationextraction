They showed that pre - incubation of HIV - 1 virions with these molecules rendered them noninfectious and blocked further cell infection . Two hypotheses may explain these results ( Figure 1 ) . The conjugates may have been able to enter the virion particles and bind to the TAR region of the viral RNA . The PNA - CPP may also have altered or disrupted the viral envelope through the interaction of the CPP moiety with the viral lipid bilayer , thereby inhibiting host cell infection . The authors showed that brief exposure of virions to CPP - PNA conjugates blocked endogenous reverse transcription within virion particles , arguing in favor of a virucidal effect due to the PNA moiety interaction with the viral RNA . However , their work set the stage for exploring anti - HIV - 1 activity displayed by CPPs on their own . CPPs share structural similarities and membrane - binding properties with another class of peptides : the antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) [ 31 ] . AMPs are small peptides carrying basic and hydrophobic residues . They are found in all living organisms . Mainly produced by leukocytes and epithelial cells , they are major players in the innate immune response against infectious agents . Interestingly , AMPs have been put forward as one potential class of novel antivirals . Their antimicrobial activity has been reported against both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses , blocking viral infection in different ways [ 110 ] : they can directly inactivate the virion through disruption of its envelop or interaction with its glycoproteins ; they can act on infected cells possibly through interactions with cell receptors resulting in alterations in cellsignaling pathways required for virus replication ; they can block the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome of the host cell , thereby interfering with viral replication ; finally , they can interact with and inhibit viral enzymes essential to the virus replication [ 111 ] . In view of the similarities between CPPs and AMPs and of the reports of anti - HSV - 1 effects of some peptides , CPP ' s potential intrinsic antiviral activity undoubtedly deserves further investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 78}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
