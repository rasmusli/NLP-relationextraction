NA belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family of proteins and catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins . Its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from HA in order to enable the virus budding . Moreover , it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces . In particular , since variations in the NA gene can lead to the evolution of more potent strains , studying the molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
