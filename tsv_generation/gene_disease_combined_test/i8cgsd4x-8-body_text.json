Studies have also shown that ubiquitinrelated genes are upregulated following bacterial infection in mosquito cells [ 32 ] . Experiments were performed to determine the significance of the proteasomal pathway in WNV infected Culex cells . Hsu cells were pretreated with 0 . 1 , 1 or 10 \u03bcM MG132 ( specific proteasomal inhibitor ) from 1 h prior to WNV infection ( MOI 10 ) , and supernatant media and total RNA from cells were collected at 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR using primers specific for WNV NS1 gene Pathway ( molecular and cellular function ) analysis was performed for all differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity software . The results are represented here as a pie - chart to indicate the contribution of major cellular pathways during WNV infection . B . Hsu cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi . Cells were mock - infected as controls . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using primers for ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway genes found to be differentially regulated in the RNA - Seq screen . RpL32 ( ribosomal protein L32 ) primers were used as an showed a dose - dependent decrease in viral replication , with the NS1 RNA level reducing by more than 80 % following treatment with 10 \u03bcM MG132 ( Fig 2A ) . Cell viability assay showed no significant toxicity for MG132 at concentrations used in the assay ( S1 Fig ) . Plaque assays internal control . The graph was plotted as fold - increase over control ( set arbitrarily at 1 , not included ) . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate . The results from the RNA - Seq experiment were also plotted on the graph for comparison . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005143 . g001", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 202}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
