Our phylogenetic analysis of 35 vampire bat Bartonella sequences showed 78 . 8 - 100 % pairwise identity in gltA and revealed at least 11 paraphyletic genotypes ( S2 Table ) . BaTS analysis of all Desmodus - associated Bartonella showed significant phylogenetic clustering by country ( association index = 3 . 81 , parsimony score = 31 . 51 , p < 0 . 001 ) , although most vampire bat Bartonella genotypes were still widely distributed ( Fig 1 ) . For the 11 genotypes delineated from our 35 sequences , we observed no association with the geographic study region ( \u03c7 2 = 23 . 3 , p = 0 . 27 ) . Genotypes 1 and 2 were detected across all regions , and genotypes 7 - 10 were detected within both Belize and Peru , highlighting the broad distribution of vampire bat Bartonella genotypes ( Fig 2 ) ; however , genotype 3 was unique to both regions of Peru , genotypes 4 - 6 were unique to the western Peruvian Amazon , and genotype 11 was only detected in Belize .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 197}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
