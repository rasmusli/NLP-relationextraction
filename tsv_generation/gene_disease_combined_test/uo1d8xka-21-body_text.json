Once the relevant data is uploaded into the workflow the remaining steps are all automated . In particular these steps comprise starting with multiple alignments of sequences to the distribution of the output to various algorithms , distributing the relevant outputs to different servers in a distributed environment which is grid compatible , and finally visualizing the output . Such a workflow system saves a significant amount of time and eliminates possible human errors in analyzing critical data .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
