In our previous investigation , activated microglia was most accumulated in mainly temporal association area , 8 h after the LPS insult . Neurons in this area were reported to be related to sociability deficits 25 . In addition , the association between autism and amygdala , especially in Lateral amygdala 26 , 27 , is well known . Moreover , the amygdala interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28 . Based on those findings , we subsequently performed Nissl staining and evaluated the number of neurons in the amygdala , cerebral cortex , and hippocampus to investigate the brain regions related to the results of the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure . The quantitative results revealed significant reductions in the number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex in the LPS - treated offspring than in the Control group ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 001 , respectively ; Fig . 3A , panels a , b , d , e and 3B ) , but not in the hippocampus ( Fig . S1 ) . The LPS - induced neuronal loss in the amygdala and cerebral cortex was improved in the HW + LPS group than in the LPS group ( p < 0 . 05 and p < 0 . 05 , respectively ; Fig . 3A , panels c , f and 3B ) . Maternal H 2 administration attenuated LPS - induced oligodendrocytic loss and suppressed astrocytic activation . The pathophysiologic mechanisms of the brain injury due to MIA are incompletely understood ; however , under prenatal inflammation , activated astrocyte was reported to have a potential cause an adverse effect on neurons and oligodendrocyte , which would result in the abnormal behaviors in later life 29 . The number of oligodendrocytes was evaluated by using Olig2 , a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of cells in the oligodendroglial lineage , and a mature oligodendrocyte marker 30 , 31 . Compared with the Control group , the number of Olig2 - positive cells was clearly reduced in the white matter , amygdala , and cerebral cortex in the LPS group ( p < 0 . 01 , p < 0 . 05 , and p < 0 . 05 , respectively ; Fig . 4A , panels a , b , d , e , g , h and 4C ) . H 2 treatment completely blocked the LPS - induced decrease of Olig2 - positive cells in all three regions ( p < 0 . 01 , p < 0 . 05 , and p < 0 . 01 , respectively ; Fig . 4A , panels c , f , i and 4C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1739, "end": 1745}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
