Consistent with the cell cycle analyses , 3D down - regulated the expression of cyclinD , CDK4 , CDK2 , and cyclinE1 ( Figure 4E ) , while 3C down - regulated the expression of CDK1 and cyclinB1 ( Figure 4F ) . Therefore the non - structural protein 3C facilitates exit from G2 / M and the non - structural protein 3D mediates arrest in G0 / G1 ( Figure 4G ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
