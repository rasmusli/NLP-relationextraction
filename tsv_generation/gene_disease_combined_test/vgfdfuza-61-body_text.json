The example of AMR in Singapore brings to light the increasing need to address the social , economic , political , cultural , and behavioral aspects influencing AMR rather than just focusing on the technical solutions . Unless we understand how all these aspects operate and drive the response , it will be difficult to design appropriate policy interventions . In the next paragraphs we provide an example of each of these aspects to highlight their importance in the Singaporean setting . We address \" the social \" by analyzing how AMR has been socially constructed in Singapore ; we discuss the influence of \" politics \" by considering power relations and governance approaches for the successful control of AMR ; we address \" behavioral aspects \" by analyzing vested interests ; and we consider \" cultural components \" by exploring how patients ' cultural beliefs influence antibiotic consumption .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
