She had no other symptoms , in particular no diarrhea , abdominal pain , vomiting or rash . Except for the elevated temperature , the patient ' s vital signs were normal ( the respiratory rate was 35 breaths / min ) , there was no sign of severe sepsis or respiratory distress , and the detailed physical examination did not reveal any abnormality . The caregivers responded negatively to questions about the presence of acute disease in contact persons or chronic disease in the child . The leukocyte count ( leukocytes 33 \u00d7 10 9 / L with a neutrophilic predominance ) , C - reactive protein ( 139 . 1 mg / mL ) and procalcitonin levels ( 5 . 772 \u00b5g / L ) were elevated . Other blood tests were within the normal range ( hemoglobin 9 . 7 g / dL , alanine transaminase 43 U / L , hematocrit 29 . 1 % and platelets 453 \u00d7 10 9 / L ) . The urine dipstick was positive for leukocytes , and thus the patient was treated with cotrimoxazole , but the urine culture was sterile . As mentioned , no viral , bacterial or parasitic agent was evidenced after a broad range of investigations , including blood culture . In particular , virological screening included the following specific real - time RT - PCR assays : influenza A and B ; respiratory syncytial virus ; metapneumovirus ; PIV types 1 and 3 ; rhinovirus ; enterovirus ; coronavirus ( HKU1 , NL63 , 229E and OC43 ) ; bocavirus ; adenovirus ; human herpesvirus 6 ; parvovirus B19 ; dengue ; chikungunya ; West Nile and Rift Valley viruses .
