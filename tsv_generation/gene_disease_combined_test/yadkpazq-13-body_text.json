Experiments were carried out in a 96 - well format . For stimulation of adherent cells with supernatants ( production see below ) , total cell culture medium was discarded from the wells and the monolayers were further cultured in 100 \u03bcL undiluted supernatants for the rest of the experiment . At time points relevant to each experiment , the supernatants were removed and cells were lysed with mRNA lysis buffer ( mRNA isolation kit I , Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) . mRNA extractions were performed with the mRNA Isolation Kit I and MagNA Pure LC Instrument ( Roche Diagnostics ) and first strand cDNA was synthesized with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) . Real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) reactions consisted of 5 \u03bcL cDNA in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL per reaction using the TaqMan \u00ae Fast Universal PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . Thermocycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 20 s at 95 \u00b0 C followed by 45 cycles of amplification by melting at 95 \u00b0 C for 3 s and annealing at 60 \u00b0 C for 45 s . Primers and probes for feline genes have been previously described [ 58 ] . mRNA expression factors of selected genes , which correspond to ratios of mRNA levels measured in ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 stimulated versus PBS stimulated cells , were calculated and normalized with GeNorm version 3 . 5 [ 59 ] , using either both feline \u03b2 - glucuronidase ( GUSB ) and tryptophan 5 - monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide ( YWHAZ ) ( usually ) or Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) alone ( when specified ) as reference genes , under conditions validated for the feline species [ 60 ] . Generally depicted in the graphs are mean expression factors calculated from duplicate experiments carried out simultaneously . Where results of one cat are illustrated , experiments were conducted with cells of at least 3 individual animals and representative data is shown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 705, "end": 710}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
