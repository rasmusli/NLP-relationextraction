The concentration of each protein was adjusted to be 1 . 5625610 23 [ 19 ] . However , when we introduced the same unit amounts of DNase I and 3D8 scFv into HeLa cells using a microporator , the antiviral effects of the 3D8 scFv protein were almost 8 - fold higher than those of DNase I ( Figure S2C ) . This result indicates that 3D8 scFv has a greater antiviral effect than DNase I , most likely due to the additional RNase activity of 3D8 scFv ( Figure S2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 9}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
