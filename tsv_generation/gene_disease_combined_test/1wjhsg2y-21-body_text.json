To highlight the gap in research effort on bats and their associated viruses , including coronaviruses , in Western Asia we conducted a literature review of specific search terms by country in PubMed ( see Figures 3 , 5 and 6 ) . PubMed is a freely available literature database containing nearly 30 million citations dating from 1948 to 2019 , and is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) [ 120 ] . We extracted the number of publications per country indexed in PubMed using package rentrez [ 121 ] based on the following combinations of search terms : ( 1 ) ( \" bat \" OR \" bats \" OR \" Chiroptera \" [ All Fields ] ) , ( 2 ) ( \" bat \" OR \" bats \" OR \" Chiroptera \" [ All Fields ] ) AND ( \" virus \" OR \" viruses \" [ All Fields ] ) , and ( 3 ) ( \" bat \" OR \" bats \" OR \" Chiroptera \" [ All Fields ] ) AND ( \" coronavirus \" OR \" coronaviruses \" [ All Fields ] ) ( Table 1 ) . Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [ 122 ] and viridis [ 108 ] in R version 3 . 4 . 3 [ 109 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
