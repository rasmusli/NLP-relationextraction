To breach the very first line of defense , the skin - TBFVs use the tick to deliver the virus through the skin via tick saliva . Furthermore , tick saliva contains immunomodulatory compounds that enhance viral transmission and dissemination [ 175 , 176 ] . Although there are several mechanisms in which mosquito - borne flaviviruses actively suppress the induction of type I IFN , no such mechanism has been identified in tick - borne flaviviruses so far [ 177 ] . Instead , TBEV , like other flaviviruses , utilizes a passive evasion mechanism in which the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes , and thus delaying the recognition by the cytosolic RIG - I like receptors and subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN induction ( Figure 4A ) [ 80 , 81 , 83 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 484}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
