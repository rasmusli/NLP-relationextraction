As a first step , we challenged porcine nasal mucosa explants from four different pig donors with both JEV genotype 1 strain Laos and genotype 3 strain Nakayama , in comparison to mock control ( Fig . 1 ) . After 48 h postinfection ( hpi ) , JEV envelope ( E ) protein was detected in epithelial cells ( Fig . 1A and B ) , with a more efficient infection found with the Laos strain - challenged tissues . An increase in JEV RNA loads from both strains was also detected in porcine nasal mucosa , indicative of virus replication ( Fig . 1C ) . JEV Laos RNA showed an increase in expression from 24 hpi on , further increasing at 48 hpi . The Nakayama strain displayed a slower viral RNA increase , with only three out of four positive samples 48 hpi ( Fig . 1C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 319}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
