Understanding the structure of an RNA molecule is important in inferring its function [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] .

While thermodynamics - based approaches can be less accurate than comparative - based algorithms , thermodynamics - based approaches are applicable in cases of novel RNAs such as the many RNAs of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium [ 24 ] . Thermodynamics - based approaches can also be easier to apply to prediction of the structure of interacting RNA molecules , for example , in gene knockdown studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
