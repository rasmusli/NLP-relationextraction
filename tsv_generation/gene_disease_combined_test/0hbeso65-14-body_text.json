Glucocorticoids are often given as an induction protocol during LT , and low doses combined with other immunosuppressants are used as maintenance immunosuppression after operation . In case of acute rejection , recipients receive pulse methylprednisolone to reverse the rejection . There are convincing data that bolus doses of glucocorticoids given for rejection treatment have a negative impact on HCV recurrence . It is estimated that cumulative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with increased mortality , higher levels of HCV viremia , and more severe histological recurrence [ 34 ] . One recent study demonstrated that glucocorticosteroids specifically increased HCV entry by upregulating the cell entry factors occludin and scavenger receptor class B type I . The data suggested that the potential effects of high - dose glucocorticosteroids on HCV infection in vivo may be due to increased HCV dissemination [ 35 ] . Previous studies have indicated that the specific CD4 T cell response to HCV is important in viral clearance of acute HCV infection after liver transplantation . Moreover , plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against HCV infection in this specific CD4 T cell response [ 36 , 37 ] . Experimental data have shown that prednisolone suppressed the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by promoting their apoptosis [ 38 ] . Thus , in a transplant setting , the consensus is that steroid avoidance or slow tapering of the dose is associated with reduced HCV recurrence [ 39 , 40 ] , whereas boluses for treating acute rejection can increase the viral load [ 31 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 753}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
