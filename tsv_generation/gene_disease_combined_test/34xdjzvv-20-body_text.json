This model might serve as an experimental model for aiding the evaluation of anti - EV71 therapeutic medicine . The application of humanized monoclonal antibodies to control various viral infections was reported [ 39 , 40 ] . Therefore , humanized N3 is expectable to serve as therapeutic agent to treat HFMD diseases in the future . It is also of interest to further evaluate whether CVA16 could elicit cross - neutralizing antibodies against different EV71 genotypes in this model .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 558, "end": 590}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
