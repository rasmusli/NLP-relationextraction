The molecule was administered once subcutaneously to two cats ( c07 and c08 ) , while two other cats ( c05 and c06 ) received endotoxin - free PBS as a negative control . The injections were well tolerated by all cats : no rise in body temperature , no local reactions at the injection site and no other undesired side effects were noted . Absolute monocyte counts increased 1 . 5 to 2 - fold in the first 12 h in cats that had received ODN 2216 ( data not shown ) . No other treatment - specific alterations were noted in hematological values throughout the experiment . Mx expression was measured in blood at early time points after injection as marker for the induction of antiviral immune processes . mRNA levels of Mx increased by 8 . 8 and 3 . 8 - fold within 24 h in both treated cats and decreased gradually thereafter until 192 h post treatment ( Figure 7A ) . In accordance with observations from in vitro experiments , cat c08 exhibited a stronger response to ODN 2216 than cat c07 . No increase in Mx expression was observed in the blood of the control cats ( c05 and c06 ) . In a further experiment , plasma was collected from all four cats at regular intervals post injection and was utilized in an in vitro inhibition assay . The plasma obtained from both treated cats 24 and 48 h after administration of the molecule was able to inhibit replication of FCV in vitro ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , plasma from untreated cats seemed to slightly enhance the susceptibility of target cells to FCV inoculation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 701, "end": 704}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
