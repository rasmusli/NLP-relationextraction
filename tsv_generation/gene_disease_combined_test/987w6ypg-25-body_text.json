Two days afterwards , cells were challenged as above with R5 - tropic replication - Figure 4 IFITMs are interferon - regulated proteins that display heterogeneous cell type dependent expression and appear incorporated in HIV - 1 virions proportionally to their intracellular levels . A ) The ectopic expression levels of IFITMs in HEK293T cells used before were compared to the endogenous expression of IFITMs in different cells , incubated or not with IFN\u03b1 ( at 1000 U / mL for 24 hours ) . Given that the antibodies in our hands did not distinguish between IFITM members anti - IFITM1 , \u2212 2 and \u2212 3 antibodies were used together , so that all three forms are recognized . B ) HEK293T and HeLaP4 cells were transfected with DNAs coding HIV - 1 - gfp and twenty - four hours later cells were stimulated with 1000U / mL of IFN\u03b1 for further two days . Virions were then purified and analyzed by WB and upon exo - RT normalization they were used to challenge HeLa P4 cells . C ) Primary macrophages obtained upon differentiation of monocytes in M - CSF for 4 days were challenged with an MOI of 0 , 1 of the R5 - tropic HIV - 1 strain ADA . Aliquots of the supernatant were harvested every few days and the extent of viral spread through the culture was measured by exo - RT activity . Cells and virion particles were harvested at the indicated time points after infection . Virion particles obtained from day 6 and 9 were normalized by exo - RT activity , while the amount of virus obtained at day 3 was too low to be quantified further . Exo - RT normalized virions obtained at day 6 and 9 were used to challenge HeLaP5 cells for a MAGI assay . The graph presents a typical replication curve obtained upon infection of ADA in primary MDM and the dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay . All WB panels present representative results obtained out of 3 to 5 independent experiments and donors , while the graphs present averages and SEM of 3 independent experiments . competent ADA at an MOI of 1 prior to extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment . Viral particles produced by knockdown cells were then harvested 4 to 6 days after and upon exo - RT normalization , viruses were used on HeLaP5 cells ( expressing the CCR5 co - receptor ) for a MAGI assay ( Figure 5B ) . Under these conditions , viruses produced in MDM silenced for IFITMs displayed a remarkable increase in their infectivity over a single round infection assay , confirming the positive effect that the removal of IFITMs plays on the infectivity of viral particles . Of note , the basal expression of IFITMs was higher in miR30 - shRNA transduced MDM , irrespectively of the target sequence , when compared to untreated cells ( for example , compare the basal levels of expression observed here with the one of Figure 4A ) . We believe this is due to the detection of the HIV vectors used for silencing , or to the detection of its end products , ie double stranded RNAs , as described in [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] . However , since equal conditions were used for control and specific knockdowns , we believe this not to be a confounding factor in the analysis of the results .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
