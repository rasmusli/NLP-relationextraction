Animal shelters are conducive environments for pathogen emergence or re - emergence because of a large number of susceptible hosts living in a confined area . This is exacerbated by factors including young age , immunological naivety or immunosuppression , close contact and co - morbidities such as heavy parasite burdens . Similarly , suboptimal biosecurity protocols favour pathogen persistence and fomite transmission [ 34 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
