Hence , the idea to develop neutralizing mouse mAbs as a strategy to prevent the entry of MERS - CoV into host cells was led by Du et al . [ 75 ] . mAbs were made by vaccinating mice with IgG1 Fc to which recombinant MERS - CoV S1 was fused [ 75 ] . Consequently , Mersmab1 , the most effective murine mAb was developed that targeted MERS - CoV RBD , and successfully neutralized MERS - CoV infection in Vero E6 , Huh - 7 and Calu - 3 cells [ 76 ] . These studies indicated the potential of humanized mAbs as efficient curative agents against infection caused by MERS - CoV . Around April 2014 , three independent studies first reported to have developed complete humanized MERS - CoV neutralizing mAbs [ 77 , 78 ] . All these humanized mAbs specifically targeted the MERS - CoV RBD glycoprotein . The efficacy of human mAbs against MERS - CoV infection was first exhibited by Qiu et al . [ 79 ] . They were able to completely treat MERS - CoV infection of lethal nature with a single dose of humanized mAbs in the hDPP4 transgenic mouse [ 79 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 53}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
