Nurses in high TB burden settings are at higher risk of developing latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) when compared to the general population , due to their exposure to the large number of smear - positive TB cases managed at hospitals or healthcare facilities [ 3 ] . Working in a high - risk TB setting can lead to harrowing experiences for healthcare , especially where health facilities are poorly equipped and managed . Health Care Workers ( HCWs ) , especially nurses , have higher rates of latent and active TB than the general population due to persistent occupational TB exposure , particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed TB in healthcare facilities and TB infection control programmes are absent or poorly implemented [ 4 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
