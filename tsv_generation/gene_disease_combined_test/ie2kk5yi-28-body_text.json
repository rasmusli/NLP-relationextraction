For example , a survey of vampire bats within Guatemala found neither geographic , dietary , demographic , or viral coinfection correlates of Bartonella infection status [ 44 ] . Using a larger sample across a more diverse range of study sites and timepoints , we here show that Bartonella is genetically diverse , geographically widespread and endemic within vampire bat populations , and that individual - level odds of infection are highest for large , male , and nonreproductive bats . Furthermore , we use several approaches to suggest vector - borne transmission to be likely in addition to possible direct contact and environmental sources of Bartonella exposure in bats .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
