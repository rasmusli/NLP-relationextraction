To test this , we generated mutant 2A 29K and 3C 52R proteases through site - directed mutagenesis of our overexpression vectors . We then cotransfected these proteases and the wildtype controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 \u00b5M DFMO - treated Veros . At 24 h , we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone ( no protease ) . We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO - sensitive ( Figure 5A , B ) . Interestingly , we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity , even in DFMO - treated cells . We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 63}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
