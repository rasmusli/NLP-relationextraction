Most works in this field initially described protection of mice against bacterial [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] and parasitic [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] infections . More recently , induction of resistance to viral infections was shown also in mouse models for Herpes Simplex Virus [ 48 ] , neurotropic arenavirus [ 49 ] , foot and mouth disease virus [ 50 ] and Vaccinia virus [ 51 ] . With exception of the latter , all these studies were carried out with CpG - B . In an outbred species , partial antiviral protection has only been described in two studies so far , in which reduced shedding of herpes and parainfluenza viruses was observed in lambs after administration also of a CpG - B [ 52 , 53 ] . To our knowledge , prophylactic antiviral potential of CpG - A has not yet been described in outbred animals .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
