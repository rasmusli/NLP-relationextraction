Coinfection with multiple parvovirus strains has occurred , potentially facilitating recombination and leading to high genetic heterogeneity . 8 Recently , a Japanese research group provided clear evidence of recombination between CPV and FPLV under field conditions . 9 Interestingly , an analysis of the HN - ZZ1 sequence with the recombination detection programs RDP3 and GARD suggested that the HN - ZZ1 strain is a novel recombinant virus between CPV and FPLV . The RDP3 program identified nt position 2696 as an ending breakpoint , and a predicted recombination region was located around positions 1328 and 2696 of the alignment . Among the nucleotide sequence data for all 25 strains entered the RDP3 program , this part possessed the greatest similarity ( 99 . 3 % ) to the corresponding part of CPV - 2b strain CPV - 447 isolated from Germany ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . The GARD program identified nt position 2558 as a putative breakpoint for recombination . The alignment was cut at this point , and separate phylogenies for each section of HN - ZZ1 were constructed . The first half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing CPV , while the latter half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing FPLV . In addition to the HN - ZZ1 strain isolated in the tigers , there is strong evidence supporting recombination events in the genomic sequences of MEV _ LN - 10 previously isolated from mink , and XJ - 1 and HRB - CS1 previously isolated from cats in China . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene of the HN - ZZ1 strain and 21 reference strains showed that the VP2 gene of HN - ZZ1 aligned with the FPLV branch originating in Felidae and clustered in the FPLV branch . This study also indicated that the VP2 gene of HN - ZZ1 showed a relatively distant relationship from those of the Purevax and Felocell vaccine strains . We speculated that the differences in the VP2 genes between the wild type and vaccine strains may be one of the factors underlying the failure of vaccination against FPLV . 13 Interestingly , the nucleotide sequence of the NS1 gene was more closely related to the CPV branch originating in dogs and clustered with virus strains in the CPV branch ( Figure 1A ) . We analyzed host - specific sites of key amino acids in the VP2 protein of the HN - ZZ1 strain and found that the amino acids at positions 80 , 93 , 103 , 300 , 305 , 323 , 564 and 568 of VP2 were identical to those of FPLV reference strains . However , the NS1 protein of the HN - ZZ1 strain had amino - acid characteristics of CPV , with the exception of the amino acid at position 248 ( Figure 1B ) . 6 An analysis using other evolutionary models , such as the Jukes - Cantor method , produced trees with nearly identical topologies ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 441}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
