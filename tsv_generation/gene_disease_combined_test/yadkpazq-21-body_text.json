With the objective to test whether ODN 2216 could exert such properties in feline immune cells , the expression of B7 . 1 and MHCII was measured by flow cytometry in stimulated PBMCs of the same eight cats as above . The expression of both co - stimulatory molecules was evaluated in gates defined to contain a PBMC population , a lymphocyte population and a non - lymphocyte population of cells . The observed effects varied considerably between the cells of individual cats , ranging from no alterations to an increase of 400 % stained cells in some cellular subpopulations after ODN 2216 stimulation . Also , in some animals , stimulation with the control ODN 2243 indicated similar staining patterns as PBS , whereas in other cats the induction of effects comparable to those of ODN 2216 could be observed . The response of cells originating from a particular cat to stimulation with ODN 2243 did not however correlate with the influence of ODN 2216 on the expression of either surface molecule on these same cells . Overall , an increased expression of both B7 . 1 and MHCII was measured in gated PBMCs upon a 24 h stimulation with ODN 2216 when overlaid with the expression of these molecules after ODN 2243 or PBS stimulation ( Figure 1B and C ) . Considering all eight cats , lymphocytic cells expressed significantly higher levels of B7 . 1 and MHCII when exposed to ODN 2216 than after treatment with PBS ( p = 0 . 0195 and p = 0 . 039 respectively , Figure 1D and F ) . Feline MHCII expression on lymphocytes also seemed to be affected by ODN 2216 and ODN 2243 in a similar manner ( Figure 1F ) . For nonlymphocytic cells , ODN 2216 more specifically affected the expression of B7 . 1 molecules , inducing significant upregulation of surface levels of this molecule when compared to stimulation with ODN 2243 ( p = 0 . 0391 ) and PBS ( p = 0 . 0039 ) for 24 h ( Figure 1E ) . In contrast , the expression of MHCII was not significantly altered in cells gated as non - lymphocytes at this time point after stimulation ( Figure 1G ) . Finally , the cells of the three cats ( c08 , c09 and c12 ) that exhibited the highest proliferation rates in response to ODN 2216 ( Figure 1A ) also indicated the strongest increase in expression of both cell surface molecules in all cellular subpopulations tested .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 150, "end": 187}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
