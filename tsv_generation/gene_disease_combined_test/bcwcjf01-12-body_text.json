PCR products were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Sequencing of an aliquot of a subset of 40 samples was carried out by Eureka Genomics , Hercules , CA using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx . Another aliquot of the same samples plus an additional 4 samples were set for 454 sequencing at the Brigham Young University DNA", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
