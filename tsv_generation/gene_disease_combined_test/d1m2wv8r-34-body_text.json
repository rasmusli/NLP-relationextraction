Proteins identified with two or more unique peptides were considered as a highly confident identification and used for quantification . Also , to ensure the accuracy of quantification , only the proteins whose coefficient of variation of three biological repeats were less than 20 % were identified as DEPs . The protein ratios were calculated from channels ( 114 / 113 to 119 / 113 ) for all proteins identified in each iTRAQ experiment . Two identical mock samples , with iTRAQ labels of 113 and 114 , were used as references . The fold threshold for changed protein fold - change ratios was set at \u00b1 1 . 20 , which covers a 95 % quantification area based on the normal distribution of two mock samples ( 113 versus 114 ) in all biological replicates 57 . Thus , the proteins with fold - change ratios \u2265 1 . 20 or \u2264 0 . 83 were selected as DEPs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
