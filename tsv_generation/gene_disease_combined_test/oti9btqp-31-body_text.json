The cell stimulation cocktail ( plus protein transport inhibitors ; PMA ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ) , ionomycin , brefeldin A and monensin ; eBioscience ) was used as a positive control and R10 media as the negative control . All the cells were then stained for surface and intracellular proteins as described by the manufacturer ' s instructions ( BD Biosciences , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Briefly , the cells were washed in FACS buffer ( PBS containing 0 . 1 % sodium azide and 1 % FBS ) before surface staining with flourochrome - conjugated antibodies . The cells were washed with FACS buffer , fixed and permeabilised using the BD Cytofix / Ctyoperm TM ( BD Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol followed by intracellular staining . The following antibodies were used for surface staining : LIVE / DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell stain kit ( Invitrogen ) , CD19 ( V450 ; clone 1D3 ; BD Biosciences ) CD4 ( FITC ; clone RM4 - 5 ; eBioscience ) , CD8 ( APC - Cy7 ; clone 53 - 6 . 7 ; BD Biosciences ) ; CD44 ( BV711 ; clone IM7 ; BioLegend , San Diego , CA , USA ) . For intracellular staining , the following antibodies were used : IFN - \u03b3 ( APC ; clone XMG1 . 2 ; BioLegend ) , TNF - \u03b1 ( PE ; clone MP6 - XT22 ; eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) , CD3 ( PerCP / Cy5 . 5 ; clone 145 - 2C11 ; Bio ) ; IL - 2 ( PeCy7 ; clone JES6 - SH4 ; eBioscience ) . All the data were collected using a LSRII flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) and analysed using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR , USA ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
