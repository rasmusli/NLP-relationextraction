Similarly , analyses with the WikiPathway tool demonstrated enrichment for \" striated muscle contraction \" and \" calcium regulation in the cardiac cell \" ( Table 5 ) . In agreement with the GO and pathway results , the pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was enriched with higher order muscle phenotypes such as \" abnormal cardiac muscle contractility , \" \" abnormal cardiac tissue morphology , \" and \" abnormal heart size \" ( Figure 3 ) . Enrichment for pathways related to both abnormal contractility and calcium signaling / regulation led us to investigate the ion channels and regulatory proteins expressed in the extended gene network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
