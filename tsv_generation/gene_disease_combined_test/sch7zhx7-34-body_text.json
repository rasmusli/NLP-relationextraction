To this end , we treated Veros with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h . Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ) . In untreated cells , we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3 - 2A 29K , - 3C 52R , or double protease mutant . However , with DFMO treatment , eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection , as previously observed ( Figure 4A ) . When we analyzed DFMO - treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3 , we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G , significantly higher than wildtype CVB3 . In total , our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity . controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 \u00b5M DFMO - treated Veros . At 24 h , we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone ( no protease ) . We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO - sensitive ( Figure 5A , B ) . Interestingly , we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity , even in DFMO - treated cells . We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
