{"cord_uid": "u14tj0so", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4064103", "divid": "11", "text": "We previously presented HFold [ 48 ] , an approach for prediction of pseudoknotted structures , motivated by two goals , namely to avoid the high running time complexity of other methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction and to leverage the hierarchical folding hypothesis . This hypothesis posits that an RNA molecule first folds into a pseudoknot - free structure ; then additional base pairs are added that may form pseudoknots with the first structure so as to lower the structure ' s free energy [ 49 ] . Given a pseudoknot - free structure as input , HFold predicts a possibly pseudoknotted structure from a broad class that contains the given input structure and , relative to that constraint , has minimum free energy . HFold ' s running time is O ( n 3 ) , significantly faster than other methods for predicting pseudoknotted structures . Several experts have provided evidence for , and support , the hierarchical folding hypothesis [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] . The class of structures that HFold can handle , density - 2 structures , is quite general and includes many important pseudoknots including Htype pseudoknots , kissing hairpins and infinite chains of interleaved bands , with arbitrary nested ( pseudoknotted ) substructures . ( Roughly , a structure is density - 2 if no base is enclosed by more than two overlapping pseudoknotted stems . ) Another advantage of HFold over heuristic methods such as HotKnots or ShapeKnots is that unlike these methods , HFold minimizes the free energy of the possibly pseudoknotted output structure relative to the given input structure . Therefore HFold ' s method of adding pseudoknotted stems is better motivated energetically than that of HotKnots or ShapeKnots .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1106, "end": 1118}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
