Data were checked for normality with the Shapiro - Wilk test and homogeneity of variances with the Levene ' s test and subsequent statistical tests chosen accordingly . We used the lmer function from the package lme4 [ 66 ] to perform a linear mixed effect analysis to test for differences of viral titers over time between the treatments . The logarithm of the viral titers entered the model as a response variable . As fixed effects , we used sampling week and treatment including their interaction term . As a random effect , we added the colony identity to control for multiple testing of the same colonies ( week [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] . Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal deviations from homoscedasticity or normality . p - values were obtained by comparing the model with the effect in question against the model without it , using an ANOVA as a likelihood ratio test . The post - hoc pairwise comparison was then performed using the Bonferroni correction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
