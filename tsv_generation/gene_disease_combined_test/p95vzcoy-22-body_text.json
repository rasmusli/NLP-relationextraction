{"cord_uid": "p95vzcoy", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6920936", "divid": "22", "text": "Our results suggest that the ant M . rubra can be an alternative host for both DWV A and B as a result of foodborne transmission because of the presence of both high viral titers and the negative - sense RNA strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus - infected food has been consumed . These results further support that DWV has a wide host range including other predatory insects [ 14 , 15 , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] 37 ] . Interestingly , there were only two ant species from the family Formicidae among the more than 60 species in which DWV has been detected so far [ 21 ] . It is obvious that recently consumed highly virus infected food like honeybee pupae , containing the virus negative - sense strand , might lead to false positive results simply because of the presence of viral particles in ant ' s gut . Because of the delayed sampling , we can however expect that the gut content of the ants has been cleared out at least once before the virus analyses [ 55 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 215}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
