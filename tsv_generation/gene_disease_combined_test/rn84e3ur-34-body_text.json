Besides , some of the passengers seated 2 - 3 rows behind and 4 - 7 rows in front of the index patient may also have lower intake fractions after the movement . Thus the variation of the intake fractions also depends on the location of the passengers and the index patient . Besides , although the intake fractions of the passengers are changed by the movement of the standing person , no significant differences can be found between the distribution characteristics of the intake fractions of different cases . Passengers seated farther away from the index patient have much lower intake fractions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
