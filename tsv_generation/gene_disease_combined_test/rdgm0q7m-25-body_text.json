Here , we show that the active frameshift - stimulatory element in fact comprises a complex of viral nsp1 [UNK] and a cellular poly ( C ) binding protein . PCBPs have been shown to regulate gene expression at multiple levels , including transcription , mRNA processing , mRNA stabilization and translation ( reviewed in Refs . 25 , 26 ) . Hitherto , a role for PCBPs in protein synthesis has been limited to translation initiation , mostly in the recruitment of ribosomes to viral IRESes ( see Ref . 40 ) . Their activity in stimulating PRF in PRRSV is the first example of a role for PCBPs in modulating translational elongation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
