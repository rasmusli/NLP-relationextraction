Here we introduce a dedicated web tool dubbed Sequence Name Annotation - based Designer ( SNAD ) that provides a versatile facility with user - friendly interface for automatic conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically informative names and acronyms in controllable manner using annotation associated with sequences . Several examples are provided to illustrate how SNAD can be used to generate names for practical purposes , particularly in virology . Implementation SNAD ( ver . 1 . 6 ) is accessible at http : / / veb . lumc . nl / SNAD . SNAD code is written in Perl ( BioPerl for dynamic retrieval of entries from databases , CGI for interfacing Perl code with web server , original Perl code for analysis of sequence objects retrieved from databases , and conversion of sequence annotation into complex names , part of application programming interface - API ) , JavaScript ( graphical user interface for uploading data , designing format of name conversion and representing results ) , Java ( part of API ) and HTML for SNAD web site pages ( see http : / / veb . lumc . nl / SNAD where a detailed description of all SNAD options and parameters can be found ) . SNAD can be used as a web server with APIs in Perl and Java available on SNAD web site . SNAD recognizes input as alignment or tree with the use of BioPerl drivers ( Bio : : TreeIO and Bio : : AlignIO ) . If the input is not recognized as alignment or tree , SNAD processes it as a list of identifiers separated by one or more of the following symbols : space , new line , tabulator , or comma . To map IDs on database entries , Bio : : DB : : ( GenBank , SwissProt , EMBL or SeqHound ) drivers and Bio : : EnsEMBL : : DBSQL : : DBA are used . SNAD uses standard BioPerl functions from Bio : : Seq for extracting features / annotation from the database entries ( GenBank / RefSeq / GenPept , UniProt , EMBL , SeqHound ) or functions from database programming interface ( EnsEMBL ) . Detailed description of all available functions is presented in \" Introduction \" page of the web site .
