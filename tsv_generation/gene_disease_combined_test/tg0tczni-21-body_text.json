And the frequency of CpG and TpA was significantly low at all codon positions for coding region of 48 polioviruses genomes ( mean \u00b1 S . D . = 0 . 490 \u00b1 0 . 012 ; and mean \u00b1 S . D . = 0 . 748 \u00b1 0 . 034 . both < 0 . 78 ) . The relative abundance of CpA and TpG also showed slight deviation from the ' ' normal range ' ' ( mean \u00b1 S . D . = 1 . 253 \u00b1 0 . 032 and 1 . 423 \u00b1 0 . 023 , respectively ) ( Table 5 ) . In addition , the RSCU values of the eight codons containing CpG ( CCG , GCG , UCG , ACG , CGC , CGG , CGU , and CGA ) were analyzed , to reveal the possible effects of CpG under - represented on codon usage bias . All of these eight codons were not preferential codons and were markedly suppressed . The six codons containing TpA ( UUA , CUA , GUA , UAU , UAC and AUA ) were suppressed too . Conversely , the RSCU values of the eight codons containing CpA ( UCA , CCA , ACA , GCA , CAA , CAG , CAU , CAC ) and five codons containing UpG ( UUG , GUG , UGU , UGC , CUG ) are high , and most of them ( 8 out of 13 ) were preferential codons ( Table 2 and Table 5 ) . In addition , compared with DVPVs and live attenuated strain of polioviruses genotype 1 , the wild viruses has higher frequencies of dinucleotides including CpG ( Figure 2 and Table 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
