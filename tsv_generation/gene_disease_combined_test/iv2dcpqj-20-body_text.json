The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A [ 28 ] . eEF1A also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) and regulates the virus replication [ 29 ] . Furthermore , eEF1A can be utilized as the cofactors of the viral RNA synthesis for several viruses , such as HIV - 1 [ 22 , 23 ] , TBSV [ 21 ] and WNV [ 30 ] . Previous studies on turnip mosaic virus ( TuMV ) , tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) and TBSV have shown that eEF1A interacts primarily with the viral RdRp complex , and thus acts as a chaperone and supports viral replication [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] . As members of Flaviviridae , both BVDV NS5A and HCV NS4A interact with eEF1A [ 24 , 34 ] . Thereinto , the exact role of eEF1A on the BVDV replication remains unclear [ 24 ] . The HCV NS4A inhibits the viral IRES - mediated translation , and the translation inhibitory effect of NS4A was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in the in vitro translation system [ 34 ] . However , we showed here that eEF1A negatively regulates the CSFV growth . We conclude that the different roles of eEF1A in viral replication may vary depending on the distinct interactions between eEF1A and different viruses . In this study , the eEF1A was shown to bind to the IRES and inhibit its activity , thus it is possible to suppress the CSFV replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
