Venn diagramming functional annotation , hierarchical clustering , and pathway enrichment were utilised to analyse the results . A common analysis strategy in proteomics is to look for a period in which the changes in the protein expression were the most prominent . However , such a strategy is dissociated from the status of viral infection and the impact on the infected cells . A different strategy in this study was employed that combined the detected significant changes in DEPs with viral replication and CPEs . In view of the CPEs and the one - step growth curve shown in Fig . 1b , the viral titre was increased quickly during the first 12 hpi . In addition , the DEPs involved in the mitotic cell cycle were significantly enriched by up to 6 . 74 % of the total DEPs at 12 hpi ( Fig . 3 ) . Since the cells had efficient proliferation at 12 hpi , this time point was suitable for studying the cellular proteins involved in autonomous parvovirus replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 557, "end": 562}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
