To purify the expressed proteins , we chose to use a Ni - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) affinity chromatography column for His - tagged proteins and a glutathione sepharose [UNK] 4B column for GST - tagged proteins . The two methods are similar as regards experimental procedures but differ in column chromatography and reagents , as described below : i ) Protein purification with Ni - NTA column . The column was first equilibrated with lysis buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 8 ) at five times the volume of the beads . The sample was then loaded and allowed to flow slowly in order to maximize the amount of protein bound to the beads . The flow - through solution was collected for SDS - PAGE analysis later . After the sample was completely loaded , washing buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) was added to wash off unspecific proteins bound to the beads or remaining in the column until the OD 280 reading was below 0 . 100 . The proteins of interest were eluted by adding elution buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 41}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
