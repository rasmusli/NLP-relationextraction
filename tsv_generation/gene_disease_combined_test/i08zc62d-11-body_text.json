Briefly , 15 ml GH33 sialidase solution ( 0 . 1 U ml \u00c01 ) was pre - mixed with 15 ml sample solution at different concentrations in 510 ml 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 . 0 in a cuvette . 60 ml 0 . 125 mM 4 - methylumbelliferyl - - d - N - acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate ( Sigma , catalogue No . M8639 ) in buffer at pH 5 . 0 was then added to the mixture as a substrate to start the reaction at 310 K . 4 - Methylumbelliferone was immediately quantified by fluorometric determination with a SpectraMax M 2e Multimode Reader ( Molecular Devices , USA ) . The excitation wavelength was 365 nm and the emission wavelength was 450 nm . Enzyme activity was recorded over a range of pre - incubation times ( Fig . 1a ) or concentrations ( Fig . 1b ) . The data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression program ( SigmaPlot ; SPCC Inc . , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) . The experimental enzyme activity was determined using the logistic curve represented by ( 1 ) , based on a time - driven protocol with initial velocity ,", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
