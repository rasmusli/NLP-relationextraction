The over - expression of APN on the surface and neo - vasculature of solid tumors has made it the most studied member of the M1 family of metalloproteases and the most targeted . A number of groups have developed molecules targeting APN ranging from monoclonal antibodies to synthetic peptidomimetic inhibitors of its enzymatic activity [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] . Perhaps the most well - known for APN is the cyclic tumor - homing peptide asparagine - glycine - arginine ( cyc - NGR ) originally discovered through in vivo peptide phage display 25 . This peptide has been radiolabeled for nuclear imaging and has been used to deliver therapeutic peptides and proteins in vivo to APN - expressing tissues [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] . The NGR motif mimics the structure of extracellular matrix proteins that APN is known to bind but not degrade . There are a number of drawbacks associated with the use of the cyc - NGR peptide , foremost among them is deamidation of the asparagine residue 25 . This spontaneous reaction , enhanced when the asparagine is adjacent to a glycine residue , results in the formation of isoaspartate - glycine - arginine ( isoDGR ) which is a ligand capable of binding to \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 integrin and several other integrins with lower affinity . This deamidation can lead to decreased specificity and potential off target affects 29 . Additionally , as further demonstrated by our study , the cyclic - NGR peptide alone is not therapeutic , rather it is only therapeutic when conjugated to toxins . Thus , there is a great need for low - molecular weight APN - targeted therapeutics that are stable and specific .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
