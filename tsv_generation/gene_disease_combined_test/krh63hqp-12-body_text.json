This list was then compared to those available at FluGenome . org [ 46 ] . To create a list of the 2009 - 2010 H1N1 outbreak versions , we used the collated genome list from Kedwaii , et al . [ 8 ] . Using these two accession lists , sequence data were obtained from GenBank [ 47 ] . We removed non - human / swine , non - H1N1 , and incomplete genomes from this list , obtaining 3 , 755 human and 351 swine genomes . Because there are few indels in these flu genomes , a simple first - pass alignment algorithm , written in Perl with the BioPerl toolkit [ 48 ] , was used . Essentially , we visually picked out a 6 - 10 - nucleotide candidate region close to the beginning of each of the eight strands of the flu genome that appeared mostly conserved . The algorithm scanned each set of sequences for this segment and added an appropriate number of spaces to the beginning of each for a rough alignment . Using BioEdit [ 49 ] , we simply looked for sequences that were misaligned and inserted gaps where necessary to complete the alignment , paying close attention to codon usage . In difficult and ambiguous regions , we chose to minimize the number of changes necessary to produce each variant , similar to the methodology of Carter [ 44 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
