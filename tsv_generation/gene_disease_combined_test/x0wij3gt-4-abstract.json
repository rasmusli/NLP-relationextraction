PDK1 siRNA and a PDK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE 2 on normal cell growth . The PGE 2induced PDK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA . In addition , we showed that induction of PDK1 by PGE 2 was associated with induction of the transcription factor , c - Jun protein . Silencing of c - Jun using siRNA and point mutations of c - Jun sites in the PDK1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE 2 . In contrast , overexpression of c - Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity and expression followed increased cell proliferation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 110}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
