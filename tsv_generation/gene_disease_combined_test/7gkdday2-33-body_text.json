Therefore , it is important to know true seasonality for each of the individual viral and bacterial pathogens . As we can see in Fig 4A , HRV reached its highest peak ( n = 15 ) in September and 2 nd highest peak in November ( n = 10 ) . In addition , there were six HRV positive specimens in October . From January to August , HRV circulation was roughly constant , indicating HRV transmission throughout the year . Similar to HRV , the number of RSV - infected patients reached its peak in September , when 41 ( 66 % ) of 62 patients were hospitalized . On the other hand , the hospitalization rates of RSV patients were 26 % ( n = 16 ) , 4 . 8 % ( n = 3 ) , 1 . 6 % ( n = 1 ) , and 1 . 6 % ( n = 1 ) in August , October , November , and December , respectively , whereas there were no detections of RSV - infected patients in other months . These findings suggest that RSV circulation was highly confined in August and September . In contrast to RSV , HMPV circulation reached its peak ( 50 % , n = 13 ) in January , followed by 23 % ( n = 6 ) , 19 % ( n = 5 ) , and 8 % circulation in February , December , and September . There were no enrollments of HMPV - infected patients in other months . After HRV , RSV , and HMPV , HBoV had the fourth highest detection rates in terms of numbers of HBoV - infected patients and all of them were detected between September and March . HPIV - 3 showed 2 peaks - 1 in September and another in November , each representing 6 patients , indicating hospitalization of 56 % ( n = 12 ) of HPIV - 3 - infected patients in these 2 months . The rest 9 of 21 HPIV - 3 patients were hospitalized in August , October , December , January , and February with hospitalization rates of 10 % ( n = 2 ) , 14 % ( n = 3 ) , 5 % ( n = 1 ) , 10 % ( n = 2 ) , and 5 % ( n = 1 ) , respectively . On the other hand , hospitalization rates of adenovirusinfected patients were 36 % ( n = 5 ) , 21 % ( n = 3 ) , 10 % ( n = 2 ) , 5 % ( n = 1 ) , 10 % ( n = 2 ) , and 5 % ( n = 1 ) in August , November , January , February , April , and June , respectively . Other viruses of the viral panel including HPIV - 1 , HPIV - 2 , influenza A , and influenza B appeared in small numbers of patients and were not informative for determination of seasonality . Next , we analyzed seasonality of ARI - causing bacterial pathogens . Fig 4B demonstrates that the most prevalent bacterial pathogen S . pneumoniae started appearing in August with four patients and the Acute respiratory infections in under - 5 children in Dhaka number of infected patients reached its peak in September , showing hospitalization of 9 ( 50 % ) out of 18 patients . There was only one patient enrolled in each of the months of October , November , December , January , and February for S . pneumoniae - associated hospitalization . On the other hand , the number of second most prevalent bacterial pathogen K . pneumoniae showed its peak circulation in September , as manifested by 5 cases ( 46 % ) of K . pneumoniaeassociated hospitalization in this month , followed by 3 ( 27 % ) , 1 ( 9 % ) , and 2 ( 18 % ) hospitalized cases in October , November , and January . Like S . pneumoniae and K . pneumoniae , Streptococcus species had a peak circulation in September with 4 ( 40 % ) hospitalized patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
