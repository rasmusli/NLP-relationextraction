In brief , HCV is believed to first interact with HS and LDLR on the membrane surface of hepatocytes to allow concentration of the virion . Subsequently , interaction with other host factors such as SR - BI , CD81 , CLDN1 , and OCLN ultimately leads to viral internalization via the socalled clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Fusion between viral and endosomal membranes is followed by release of the viral genome into the cytosol , where translation and replication take place . Finally , HCV particles are assembled and released from the hepatocytes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 81}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
