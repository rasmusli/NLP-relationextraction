CD69 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [ 16 ] and became detectable at 14 hours post - infection , peaked at 16 to 24 hours , and returned almost to background levels by 72 hours ( Figure 1A ) . The induction of CD69 occurred on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , as well as B cells ( Figure 1B ) . In addition to the spleen , CD69 upregulation was also observed , albeit to a lesser extent , on lymphocytes from the blood , lymph nodes , and bone marrow ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , no significant upregulation was observed on lymphocytes from the thymus , which are primarily immature T cells . In contrast to CD69 , the IL - 2 receptor alpha chain ( CD25 ) , which is upregulated later in the activation cascade and is typically dependent on TCR ligation [ 21 ] , did not increase in expression during the first day of LDV infection ( data not shown ) . This result is consistent with partial rather than full activation of the lymphocytes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
