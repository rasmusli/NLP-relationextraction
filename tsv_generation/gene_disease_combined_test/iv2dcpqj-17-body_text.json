Streptavidin pulldown assay showed that the biotinylated CSFV IRES , but not the biotinylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) 3 1 - UTR , could bind to eEF1A in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 6A , B ) . Competitive RNA pulldown assay indicated that the association of eEF1A with the CSFV IRES could be inhibited by the unlabeled CSFV IRES ( Figure 6C ) . The results demonstrated that eEF1A binds to the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 45}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
