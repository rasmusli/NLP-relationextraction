This provides a straightforward approach of constructing workflows that execute in a high - performance environment . In turn , a component running on a given server may use several computing nodes to execute its program , thereby providing a two - tiered mechanism of distributed processing . As an example , Figure 8 shows a physical workflow and its graphical counterpart . The workflow consists of a sample generator component , which generates / collects data , an analyzer component which performs the actual processing , and a sample sink component which ' consumes ' the processed data in terms of not forwarding the data further to another component . While the genera - tor and sink components can be connected to external entities , i . e . physical devices , the analyzer component may be a simple single - node program or a complex , parallel multi - node application .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 645}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
