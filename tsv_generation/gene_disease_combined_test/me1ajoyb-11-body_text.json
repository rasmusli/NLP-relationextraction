Similarly , experimentally - infected bank voles produce PUUV - specific antibodies two to three weeks after inoculation [ 14 ] and rats experimentally infected with SEOV also produce IgG within two weeks post inoculation [ 52 ] . The presence of IgG in these naturally and experimentally infected reservoirs is an indicator of class switching and affinity maturation , events that are mediated by T cells [ 53 ] . Thus , rodents mount adaptive T cell / B cell immune responses to their reservoir hantaviruses ; however , it appears to be inadequate for virus clearance . While inflammatory signatures are present [ 13 , 20 , 54 ] , the magnitude of these signals appears to be modest relative to expression levels found in a Syrian hamster pathology model of HCPS [ 55 ] . It is noteworthy that immunization of rodent reservoirs with homologous nucleocapsid antigen or plasmids encoding the antigen protects from subsequent challenge [ 56 , 57 ] , suggesting infection can be prevented in reservoir hosts .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
