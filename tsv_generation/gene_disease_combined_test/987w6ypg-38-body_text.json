To obtain virions issued from CD45 expressing cells ( CD45 is indeed mostly a T cell marker ) , SupT1 stably expressing Flag - IFITMs were challenged with replication - competent NL4 - 3 at an MOI of 3 to induce a rapid burst of infection and robust production of virion particles . Virions produced upon ongoing infection were harvested 6 days after infection and were incubated with magnetic beads coupled with an anti - CD45 antibody ( Miltenyi ) for 2 hours . Beads were then recuperated on a magnetic support following the manufacturer ' s instructions . Bound and unbound material was analyzed by WB .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 112}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
