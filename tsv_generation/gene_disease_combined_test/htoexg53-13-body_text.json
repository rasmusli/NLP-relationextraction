Non - infected ( mock ) or wild - type MVA - infected cells served as controls . Cell lysates were prepared at different time points after infection and stored at \u2212 80 \u2022 C . Total cell proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - 10 % polyacrylamide gel ( SDS - PAGE ) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane via electroblotting . After 1 h blocking in a phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) buffer containing 1 % ( w / v ) non - fat dried milk and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) NP - 40 detergent , the blots were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti - MERS - CoV Nucleocapsid antibody ( Sino Biological , Beijing , China , 1 : 1000 ) , monoclonal rabbit anti - MERS - CoV Spike Protein S1 Antibody ( Sino Biological , 1 : 500 ) , or polyclonal sera from MERS - CoV infected rabbits or cynomolgus macaques ( kindly provided by Dr . Bart Haagmans , Erasmus Medical Center , Rotterdam , 1 : 1000 ) [ 23 ] as primary antibodies . After washing with 0 . 1 % NP - 40 in PBS , the blots were incubated with anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 5000 ) , or anti - rabbit IgG antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) , or protein A ( 1 : 1000 ) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Cell Signaling Technology , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) . After further washing , blots were developed using SuperSignal \u00ae West Dura Extended Duration substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Planegg , Gemany ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 138}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
