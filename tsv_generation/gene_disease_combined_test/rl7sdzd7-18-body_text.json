The sample was originally purchased from Monsanto UK Ltd ( Cambridge , UK ) . DNA was extracted by grinding 2 g seed with 10 ml extraction buffer [ 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 1 M EDTA pH 8 and 1 % ( w / v ) SDS ] in a mortar with a pestle . The sample was emulsified with 5 ml of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 24 : 1 ) and poured into a 20 ml Falcon polypropylene tube . After centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 mins , the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and nucleic acids DNA from the oilseed rape MS8 / RF3 was extracted from seedlings from a selfed MS8 / RF3 plant [ 17 ] using DNeasy Plant DNA Extraction Kit ( QIAGEN , Crawley , UK ) . The parent plant was genotyped to be MS8MS8 / RF3rf3 using real - time PCR ( data not shown ) . The sample was quantified using picogreen fluorescence ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Invitrogen ) . DNA containing RoundUp Ready [UNK] soya was extracted from Soya Roundup Ready [UNK] GMO Reference Material ( Fluka Biochemika , Sigma - Aldrich , Dorset , UK ) and the GMO concentration of the sample has been accurately determined by dilutions of template combined with statistical analysis [ 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 579}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
