RNAs transcribed from these plasmids were translated in RRL in the presence of nsp1 [UNK] ( Figure 2A ) . PRF was found to be unaffected until the length of the PRRSV sequence downstream of the slippery sequence fell below 21 nt , at which point PRF was reduced ( 18 nt ) or abolished ( 15 or 9 nt ) . In the latter constructs , the C - rich region is compromised , consistent with an important role in PRF . Similar results were previously observed in transfected cultured cells ( Li et al . , ( 19 ) ) . To investigate the function of the C - rich region specifically , we prepared a library of individual point mutations within , and flanking , the Crich region and assessed their effect on PRF ( Figure 2B ) . It was found that changing any of the C residues to G had a detrimental effect on PRF , with the exception of the final residue ( C 13 , 3 of the conserved sequence ) , where the effect was more modest . As an explanation for these observations , we speculated that the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence may interact with PCBPs . The ' minimal ' region of PRRSV RNA required for full activity in PRF ( 21 nt ) has only two C - rich patches , whereas previously established PCBP - binding consensus sequences more commonly have three ( or more ) C - triplets , potentially with each triplet binding one KH domain ( ( 33 ) ; see below ) . However , PCBP1 and PCBP2 are amongst several candidates reported to associate with GST - tagged nsp1 [UNK] in association screens , and a direct physical interaction between the two has been shown ( 34 , 35 ) . PCBPs could therefore bind to the PRRSV mRNA by virtue of an association with nsp1 [UNK] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
