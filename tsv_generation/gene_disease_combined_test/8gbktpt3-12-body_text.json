Sequences were translated in MegaX , and amino acid substitutions compared to the ICTV reference FPV sequence ( FVP - 3 Genbank accession no . EU659111 ) were identified . To determine the evolutionary history of the outbreak sequences from Australia , New Zealand and Dubai , we performed a phylogenetic analysis including these sequences and representative VP2 sequences of FPV and CPV taken from GenBank . In addition , we included an FPV VP2 sequence obtained from tissues of a healthy feral cat from Tasmania , Australia , sampled in 2010 ( Genbank accession no . MN603976 ) , for comparison . This resulted in a total data set of 205 sequences , 1774 nt in length . Phylogenetic analysis of these was performed using the PhyML program [ 13 ] and employing the GTR + I + \u0393 model of nucleotide substitution and a combination of Nearest - Neighbor Interchange ( NNI ) and Sub - tree Pruning & Re - grafting ( SPR ) branch swapping . Nodal support was assessed using SH - like branch support . Finally , the five CPV sequences included were used as an outgroup clade to root the tree .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
