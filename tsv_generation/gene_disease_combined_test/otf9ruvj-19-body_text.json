The initial PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio in the IVIG group was significantly lower than that in the control group ( IVIG , median 67 vs control , 93 ; t test , log - transformed data , p = 0 . 009 ) . Seventy - five percent of the IVIG - treated patients had severe ARDS , 25 % had moderate ARDS , and no patient showed mild ARDS . In the control group , 55 % of patients had severe ARDS , 35 % had moderate ARDS , and 10 % had mild ARDS . The ECMO duration was shorter in the control group ( 1 - 45 days ; median 14 days ) compared to that in the IVIG group ( 4 - 78 days ; median 18 days ) and could be reduced earlier in the control group ( median 10 days ) than in the IVIG group ( median 16 days ) . The duration of ventilator support was longer in the IVIG group ( 91 - 2005 h ; median 571 h ) compared to that in the control group ( 20 - 1323 h ; median 399 h ; t test , logtransformed data , p = 0 . 055 ) . Five patients in the control group and three patients in the IVIG group were extubated before ECMO was discontinued . Ten patients in the control group and seven patients in the IVIG group suffered anemia due to bleeding complications , including cerebral hemorrhage ( control : n = 3 ; IVIG : n = 2 ) ( Table 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
