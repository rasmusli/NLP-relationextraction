First , a large body of results in virus research can be linked to underlying sequences , owing to relatively small number of known viruses and comparatively small sizes of their extensively characterized genomes . Second , the virus naming , at the species level and below , is not governed by either the binomial Latin name convention traditional for cellular organisms or another broadly accepted nomenclature [ 13 ] that complicates communication in virology . For species , naming viruses is under auspices of the International Committee of Virus Taxonomy ( ICTV ) [ 14 ] . At the isolate and strain level , it is left up to individuals or groups of researchers to decide how to proceed [ 15 , 16 ] . Researchers studying few economically most important viruses developed nomenclatures restricted for these viruses [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . In contrast , each decision about naming that concerns a majority of viruses is an ad hoc and , often , lengthy process . Likewise , naming viruses with artificially designed genomes , which are not product of natural evolution [ 23 ] , is formally outside of the ICTV authority and completely unregulated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
