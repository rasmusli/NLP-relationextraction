The extracted DNA was amplified by conventional PCR using 5 u / \u00b5L of My Taq HS Red DNA polymerase ( Bioline , USA ) , 1 - 90 ng of DNA , 1 x MyTaq Red reaction buffer and a final primer concentration of 0 . 2 \u00b5M in a final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5L . Three sets of overlapping primers were used to amplify the entire VP2 region ( 1931 bp ) as described previously , with minor modifications ( Table 1 ) [ 12 ] . An initial denaturation step at 94 \u2022 C for 1 min , followed by 35 - 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s , annealing at 50 or 55 \u2022 C for 30 s and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 30 s , ending with a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 1 min , was used for DNA amplification . The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose gel ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) in 1 \u00d7 tris - acetate EDTA and visualized using SYBR Safe DNA ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Sanger sequencing of positive PCR products was performed commercially ( Macrogen , Seoul , Korea ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 77}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
