The initial replication is believed to occur locally in the dendritic cells . This is followed by infection of the draining lymph nodes , resulting in the primary viremia and subsequent infection of the peripheral tissues , where further replication maintains the viremia for several days [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] . The disease course of TBEV is biphasic ; the initial phase is characterized by flu - like symptoms and is followed by a second phase involving CNS infection , with meningitis , encephalitis , or meningoencephalitis [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] . The mortality rate of TBEV varies from 1 to 20 % depending on the subtype , in which the European TBEV subtype has shown lower mortality rates compared to the Siberian and Far Eastern [ 23 , 40 , 44 ] . Among the patients that experience neuroinvasive TBEV infection , approximately 25 - 40 % of the survivors suffer from long lasting neurological sequelae [ 45 , 46 ] . No antivirals are available for treatment of TBEV infection but there is an effective vaccine [ 25 , 47 ] . LGTV , which is closely related to TBEV , is found in south east Asia and Russia [ 17 ] . LGTV has not been associated with human disease under natural infections although it shares 84 % sequence identity with TBEV [ 17 ] . Because of its avirulence in humans and close similarity to TBEV , LGTV is often used as a model virus for TBEV under biosafety level - 2 conditions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
