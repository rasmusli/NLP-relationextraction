We also showed that eEF1A was able to bind to the IRES located in the 5 1 - UTR and inhibit its activity . In addition , we investigated the effects of eEF1A on the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A ; however , we demonstrated that eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A , indicating that NS5A and eEF1A perhaps bind to distinct parts of the IRES .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 13}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
