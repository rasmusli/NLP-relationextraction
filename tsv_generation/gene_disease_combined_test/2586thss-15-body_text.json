The expressed proteins were purified with Ni 2 + - chelate affinity chromatography and a glutathione sepharose [UNK] 4B column . Proteins were examined using SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 3 ) . The position of the protein bands was consistent with the expected molecular weight of the different HCV segments . Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method , using BSA as the standard . Our further analyses demonstrated that the HCV proteins were pure and that they could be used directly for the construction of the HCV DAS - LFIA strip .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 56}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
