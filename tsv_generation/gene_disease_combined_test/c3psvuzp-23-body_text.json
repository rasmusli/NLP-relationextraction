First , the fact that we observe a robust evolutionary signature of positive selection in PARP4 , 9 , 13 , 14 and 15 argues strongly that these genes are important for organismal fitness . Similar to strong evolutionary conservation , signatures of positive selection indicate that fixation of a particular allele , in this case , a novel allele , results in a strong enhancement of fitness . While rapid evolution may seem antithetical to functional constraint , in fact positive selection is a common hallmark of critical host immunity genes [ 34 ] . Thus , we infer that the functions of the rapidly evolving PARP genes we have identified are important for fitness in the face of rapidly - evolving pathogens . Second , we also find that PARP14 and PARP15 show recurrent gene duplication and loss . This form of genetic innovation is another common hallmark of immunity genes . Gene losses occur during periods of relaxed selection due to non - exposure or extinction of relevant pathogen ( s ) , whereas gene duplications often provide additional genetic substrates for diversifying selection to increase anti - pathogen repertoires [ 34 , 52 ] . While other PARP proteins , such as PARP1 , PARP7 , PARP10 and PARP12 [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ] , have been identified as having antiviral functions , our initial screen suggests they have not been subject to strong recurrent antagonistic evolution with viral factors in primates , perhaps because their encoded proteins do not directly interact with virus - encoded factors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
