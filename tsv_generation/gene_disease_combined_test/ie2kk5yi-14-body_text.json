Dataset 1 was designed to assess the spatial structure of vampire bat - associated Bartonella across Latin America and therefore included our new sequences plus all previously reported gltA sequences from Desmodus rotundus . Dataset 2 was designed to capture the relatedness of the new sequences to all previously described Bartonella spp . regardless of isolation source , which comprised sequences generated in this study plus sequences obtained by conducting a BLAST search of each new sequence against GenBank , selecting the top 10 hits , and removing duplicates . For both datasets , consensus sequences were aligned using MAFFT . Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in MrBayes using the GTR + gamma model suggested by jModeltest2 [ 56 ] . For dataset 1 ( Desmodus - associated sequences ) , we fit a codon partitioned substitution model by linking rates in codon positions 1 and 2 separately from codon position 3 . For dataset 2 , we used a simpler non - partitioned model because the more complex codon - partitioned model failed to converge . Dataset 2 included one sequence from Brucella abortus ( Genbank Locus : MIJI01000003 . 1 ) as an outgroup [ 13 ] . Both datasets were run for 2 . 5 million generations with convergence checked and burn - in periods selected by assessing posterior traces in Tracer [ 57 ] . With dataset 1 , we analyzed spatial clustering of vampire bat Bartonella by country ( Belize , Guatemala , Mexico , Peru ) using Bayesian Tip Association Significance Testing ( BaTS ) [ 58 ] . We here selected 1 , 000 trees from the posterior distribution of the MrBayes run and compared the country - level clustering to a null distribution from 10 , 000 trees with swapped tip associations [ 58 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 254}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
