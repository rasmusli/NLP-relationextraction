As shown in Fig . 2b , only 3 of 437 proteins were identified at all five time points . Moreover , 22 , 28 , 27 , 82 , and 86 DEPs were separately identified at the each of the five time points , respectively . These proteins were the key proteins used to study the biological processes at certain time points .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 19}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
