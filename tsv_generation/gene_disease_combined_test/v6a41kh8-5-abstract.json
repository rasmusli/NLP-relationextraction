The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV , InfA , and PIV3 . RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics . The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro - epidemics with several respiratory viruses , highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
