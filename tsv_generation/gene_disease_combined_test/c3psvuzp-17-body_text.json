Such a conserved pattern could suggest that related genetic conflicts ( for example , similar viral pathogens ) drove their evolution . Instead , we observed that a different set of residues is rapidly evolving in each macro domain at a primary sequence level ( Figure 3C , Tables S6 - S8 and Alignment S3 ) . While equivalent amino acids are not evolving in all macro - PARPs , it is possible that positive selection has acted on a single threedimensional protein surface . We therefore modeled the positively selected residues from PARP9 and PARP14 macrodomains onto a structure that has been determined for the first macrodomain of PARP14 [ 48 ] . We found that positively selected residues map to a single surface of each macrodomain , but that each macrodomain shows positive selection on a distinct surface ( Figure 3D ) . As each positively - selected surface is distinct relative to the site of ADPribose binding , these results suggest that ADP - ribose binding is not being altered or optimized by positive selection of the macrodomains . Instead , our findings suggest that each macrodomain has engaged in its own evolutionary arms race with as - yet - unidentified pathogen factors ( see Discussion ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 30}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
