Since HFold ( HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold ) cannot accept pseudoknotted input structures we use the following methods to produce pseudoknot - free input structures to HFold ( HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold ) . First , we use HotKnots hotspots [ 36 ] , i . e . , the 20 lowest energy pseudoknot - free stems produced in the first phase of HotKnots . We choose the lowest free energy structure predicted by each of our methods as their final prediction given these hotspots . Second , we use SimFold ' s MFE structure [ 63 ] where the energy parameters of SimFold are changed to match that of HotKnots V2 . 0 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 349, "end": 367}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
