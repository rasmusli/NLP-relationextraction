Most patients with S . pneumoniae detection by PCR had also S . pneumoniae nasal carriage ( 93 . 5 % , 15 / 16 ) , while only 17 . 6 % ( 15 / 85 ) of patients with S . pneumoniae nasal carriage had positive detection by PCR ( P = 0 . 04 ) . Concordance of serotype 1 detected in nasal swabs and blood in pneumonia cases was high ( \u03ba = 0 . 70 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Coronavirus 63 was identified from pleural effusion in 1 patient . Microbiological findings , including S . pneumoniae serotypes distribution , from PCR nasal swab or blood sample were not different in pneumonia cases according to the result of urine antibiotic testing ( data not shown ) . Blood culture was positive in 36 ( 30 . 5 % ) pneumonia cases ; most microorganisms were probably related to contamination of samples . The following bacteria were detected : coagulase - negative staphyloccoci ( n = 26 ) , Salmonella spp . ( n = 3 ) , Gram - positive bacilli ( n = 2 ) , Acinetobacter baumannii ( n = 1 ) , Aerococcus viridans ( n = 1 ) , Enterococcus faecium ( n = 1 ) , Granulicatella elegans ( n = 1 ) , and Staphylococcus aureus ( n = 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
