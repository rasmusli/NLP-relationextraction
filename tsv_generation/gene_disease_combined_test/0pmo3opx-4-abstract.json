Enzymatically active APN has been documented to play import roles in tumorigenesis , angiogenesis , cell migration , and metastasis 7 - 9 . As a result of its role in cancer development and metastasis , APN has been a major target for drug development . The direct enzymatic activity of APN has been targeted using the potent transition - state analogue inhibitor bestatin ( ubenimex ) in several clinical trials 8 , 10 . Although bestatin inhibits nearly a dozen aminopeptidases , it has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in acute myeloid leukemia , gastric cancer , and squamous cell lung carcinomas [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . Other small molecule inhibitors of APN , including the natural product curucumin , have been developed and are undergoing testing in the clinic and preclinical models 10 . As with bestatin , specificity has plagued these next - generation compounds due to the limited interactions small molecules can make with the APN pharmacophore . Additional strategies for the therapeutic targeting of APN have utilized tumor - homing peptides based on the NGR motif that bind to APN and deliver", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 16}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
