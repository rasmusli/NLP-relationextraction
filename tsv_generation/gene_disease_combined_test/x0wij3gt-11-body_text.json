Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio - Rad protein assay . 5 \u03bcg protein from whole - cell lysates were solubilized in 5 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS 10 % polyacrylamide gels . Blots were incubated with antibodies against c - Jun , PDK1 , EP4 , GAPDH , and phosphorylated PDK1 ( c - Jun , PDK1 , pPDK1 and EP4 in the concentrations of 1 : 1 , 000 for 2 h ; GAPDH in the concentration of 1 : 10000 for 1 h ) at room temperature . After washing several times , the blots were followed by incubation with a secondary goat antibody raised against rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( 1 : 2 , 000 ; Santa Cruz ) . The blots were washed , transferred to fresh chemiluminescence solution ( Amersham ) for about 1 - 2 min , and exposed to X - ray film . In controls , the primary antibodies were omitted or replaced with a control rabbit IgG . for Western blot and cell growth and gel mobility shift assays .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 307, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
