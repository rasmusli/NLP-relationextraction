This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of Ttn , one of our candidate upstream regulators , is increased in atrial fibrillation patients with persistent disease ( Deshmukh et al . 2015 ) and a recent GWAS that has for the first time identified the TTN locus as a susceptibility locus for atrial fibrillation in humans ( Christophersen et al . 2017 ) . Further , genes within our gene network that are regulated by the Chr2 eQTL containing Ttn are also dysregulated in atrial fibrillation ( Rbm20 , Atp2a2 , Fndc5 , and Mybphl ) ( Deshmukh et al . 2015 ) and dysregulation of transcription factors and ion / calcium handling genes could drive the switch from working myocardium to the pacemaker phenotype observed in the pulmonary myocardium in atrial fibrillation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
