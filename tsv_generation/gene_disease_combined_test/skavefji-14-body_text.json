Twenty - eight bacterial pathogens were identified in 24 patients . In 4 patients , two different bacteria were identified . Staphylococcus aureus ( n = 5 ) was the most common bacteria , followed by Legionella pneumophila ( n = 4 ) , and Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 3 ) . Bacteria were identified from BAL fluid cultures or PCRs in 15 patients , from endotracheal aspirates or sputum cultures in 15 patients , from blood cultures in 4 patients , and from urinary antigen tests in 4 patients ( two patients with pneumococcal antigens and two patients with legionella antigens ) . Eleven patients had two or more positive tests . Twenty - six viruses were identified in 23 patients . In three patients , two different viruses were identified . Rhinovirus was the most common virus ( n = 11 ) , followed by influenza virus ( n = 6 ) , and respiratory syncytial virus ( n = 3 ) . Viruses were identified from BAL fluid specimens in 18 patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 13 patients . Viruses were detected in both in BAL fluid and nasopharyngeal samples in 8 patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 611}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
