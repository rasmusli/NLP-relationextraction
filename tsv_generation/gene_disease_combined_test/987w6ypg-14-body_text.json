Aliquots were harvested from the top of the gradient , precipitated with TCA and analyzed by WB ( Figure 2D ) . The signals obtained after WB were quantified by densitometry and were plotted here to indicate the percentage of each protein present in each fraction with respect to the overall protein present ( Figure 2D , for space constraint the graph is presented only for IFITM3 ) . Under these conditions , more than 95 % of the total IFITMs co - migrated with HIV - 1 CA in velocity gradients . These results along with similar co - migration observed between these proteins upon linear sucrose equilibrium density gradients ( data not shown ) indicate that IFITMs are virion - associated proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
