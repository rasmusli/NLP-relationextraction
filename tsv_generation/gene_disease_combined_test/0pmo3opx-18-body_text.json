Here , we have presented the most comprehensive examination of the substrate specificity of APN to date and detailed the key structural interactions that dictate this specificity . By understanding the molecular architecture of APN at the atomic level and investing its specificity with our global profiling technique , we were able to rationally design peptide inhibitors of its enzymatic activity . The S1 pocket of APN has hydrophobic walls with an open end resulting from the presence of Met349 , Phe467 and Tyr472 . As predicted from the S1 architecture , the P1 specificity of APN favored hydrophobic residues . Amino acids with large positively charged side chains ( such as arginine and lysine ) are also tolerated as substrates because their side chains can form hydrophobic and polar interactions with aforementioned residues in the S1 pocket . In contrast , acidic residues ( glutamic acid and aspartic acid ) and short - branched residues ( such as asparagine and proline ) are strongly disfavored in the P1 position due to charge and VDW repulsion , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
