Unfortunately , these three structures all appeared to have different morphologies and variable association with the ICI [ 110 ] . RNA contained in KD sample ICIs was further analyzed by using laser - capture micro - dissection and subsequent 454 sequencing . No homologies to known viral RNA sequences were shown . Specifically , of the 411 , 561 nucleic acid reads done by 454 sequencing , only 1006 did not have significant GenBank homology [ 105 ] . This lack of homology to known viral sequences and paucity of unknown sequence is also not supportive of these being VLPs or viral aggregation of an unknown virus . The limitation to only autopsy specimens , lack of similar findings in other pathological reports , lack of VLP correlation to ICI , and lack of genetic specificity in the included RNA argues against these being related to the etiology of KD .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 451}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
