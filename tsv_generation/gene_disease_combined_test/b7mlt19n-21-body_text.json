It is increasingly appreciated that autophagy can be highly selective , and that xenophagy , the selective autophagy of pathogens , is an important aspect of the immune response , which protects against infection . A vast array of viruses are associated with autophagy , and we have found several viral proteins containing putative LIR motifs that are thought to interact with the autophagic machinery via Atg8 - family proteins . A continued research effort to better understand how these viral proteins interact with the autophagic machinery may provide therapeutic strategies and ultimately lead to the discovery of novel pharmacological agents to fight viral infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 494}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
