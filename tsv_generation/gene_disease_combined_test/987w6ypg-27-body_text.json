Target cells were incubated with an equal amount of viral particles at 4 \u00b0 C , extensively washed and then shifted at 37 \u00b0 C to induce virus entry into the cell . After 2 hours , cells were treated with trypsin to remove extracellular virus and the amount of intracellular p24 was determined by ELISA . Under these conditions , all IFITMs - HIV - 1 particles presented an entry defect , indicating that IFITMs interfered with the ability of virion particles to enter target cells ( from 40 % to 70 % Figure 6B ) . To further support this argument , viruses were produced in the presence of Vpr - Blam . This protein is incorporated into virion particles and is released in the cytoplasm of target cells after viral - to - cell membrane fusion where it can cleave a fluorescent dye [ 44 ] . When viral particles incorporating Vpr - Blam were analyzed a similar decrease in entry was measured for virions incorporating IFITMs as compared to WT ( Figure 6C , from 50 to 70 % ) . Although this defect appeared more pronounced in the case of IFITM2 than of IFITM1 / 3 , this difference did not reach statistical significance .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
