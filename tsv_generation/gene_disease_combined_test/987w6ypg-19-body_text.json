This analysis indicated a certain level of cross - recognition between antibodies ( particularly with the anti - IFITM2 and \u2212 3 antibodies ) . For this reason , we decided to detect the endogenous expression of IFITMs using a pool of the 3 antibodies . We first determined the pattern of expression of IFITMs in different established cell lines and primary cells ( Figure 4A ) . Given that IFITMs are interferon - stimulated genes , these cells were also stimulated for 24 hours with 1000 U / mL of IFN\u03b1 . The basal expression of IFITMs varied among cell types and was undetectable in HEK293T cells , unless IFN\u03b1 was provided . HeLa cells expressed instead robust levels of IFITMs even in the absence of IFN\u03b1 , although this stimulus further increased their expression . Similarly , the primary human cells examined here expressed undetectable / low amounts of IFITMs under standard conditions , but expression of IFITMs was robustly induced by IFN\u03b1 stimulation . This trend was reproducibly observed in four distinct donors , although the basal levels of expression of IFITMs displayed clear donor - to donor variations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
