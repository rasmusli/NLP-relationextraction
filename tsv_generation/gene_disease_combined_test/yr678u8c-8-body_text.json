Furthermore , autophagy plays a role in presenting pathogen components to the immune system [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] . Inhibition of autophagy has a positive effect on the replication or virulence of herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV1 ) [ 26 , 27 ] , Sindbis virus [ 28 , 29 ] and vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) [ 30 ] . In addition , the capsid protein of Sindbis virus was found to be specifically targeted to the autophagosome via an interaction with the autophagy cargo receptor , p62 [ 28 ] . However , many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy by inhibiting the pathway , or diverting the process to benefit virus replication . Many viral proteins have been identified that inhibit formation of autophagosomes . For example , HSV1 protein ICP34 . 5 binds to BECN1 and inhibits autophagosome formation and Kaposi ' s sarcoma associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) and murine \u03b3 - herpesvirus ( MHV - 68 ) encode Bcl2 homologues to bind to and inhibit BECN1 [ 26 , 31 , 32 ] . KSHV also encodes another protein to block LC3 processing by inhibiting ATG3 [ 33 ] . Other viruses have developed mechanisms to inhibit fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) encoded protein Nef interacts with BECN1 , inhibiting lysosomal fusion [ 34 ] . Influenza A virus protein M2 has also been shown to induce accumulation of autophagosomes as a result of inhibition of lysosomal fusion , possibly via an interaction with BECN1 [ 35 ] . Moreover , numerous viruses have been identified which require autophagy for optimal replication , including hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) [ 36 ] , poliovirus [ 37 ] , coxsackievirus , HIV - 1 [ 38 ] , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) [ 39 ] , Dengue virus [ 40 , 41 ] and Japanese encephalitis virus [ 42 ] . Finally , poliovirus subverts autophagy in order to generate membranous structures required for assembly of viral replication complexes [ 37 , 43 ] .
