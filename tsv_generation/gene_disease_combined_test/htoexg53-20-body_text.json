The MVA DNA sequences in pIIIH5red - MERS - N ( flank - 1 , flank - 2 ) targeted the insertion of the N gene sequences into the site of deletion III within the MVA genome . The clonal isolation was facilitated by co - production of the red fluorescent reporter protein mCherry allowing for the convenient detection of MVA - MERS - N infected cells during plaque purification . The repetitive DNA sequence of flank - 1 ( FR ) served to remove the marker gene mCherry from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination ( marker gene deletion ) . After PCR analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95 % MVA - MERS - N recombinant viruses in the cultures , we selected the final marker - free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without mCherry fluorescence . To confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous N gene sequences within the MVA - MERS - N genome , we analyzed viral genomic DNA by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for MVA sequences adjacent to the deletion III insertion site ( Figure 1b In addition , the comparative Western blot analysis of cell lysates from MVA - MERS - N or MVA - MERS - S infected CEF with antigen - specific mouse monoclonal antibodies suggested the production of comparable amounts of both MERS - CoV candidate antigens ( Figure 2b ) . This observation is in line with the fact that the MVA - MERS - S candidate vector vaccine expresses the MERS - CoV S gene sequences using the identical PmH5 promoter system [ 23 ] . As shown in previous studies , we detected two MERS - CoV S - specific protein bands upon infection with MVA - MERS - S indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full - length S glycoprotein ( ~ 210 kDa ) into an N - terminal ( ~ 120 kDa S1 domain ) and a C - terminal ( ~ 85 kDa S2 domain ; not detected ) subunit [ 23 , 50 , 51 ] . Following this , we used the total protein lysates from MVA - MERS - N or MVA - MERS - S infected CEF to assess the recognition of the MERS - CoV N and S antigens by sera from experimentally MERS - CoV infected animals . The Western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit ( Figure 2c ) or a cynomolgus monkey ( Figure 2d ) revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the MERS - CoV N protein . The recognition of the MERS - CoV N protein was at least as prominent as the MERS - CoV S antigen , which was suggestive of the induction of substantial N - specific antibody responses after experimental MERS - CoV infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
