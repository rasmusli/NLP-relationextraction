Two days after transfection , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min . Nonspecific binding was then blocked with normal goat serum diluted in PBS at room temperature for 1 h . The slides were then washed in PBS for 5 min and subsequently incubated with sera from immunised mice or RM at a 1 : 100 dilutions overnight at 4 \u00b0 C . The slides were washed as described above and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody ( goat anti - mouse IgG - AF488 ; for mouse serum and goat anti - human IgG - AF488 for RM serum ; Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) at 1 : 200 dilutions at room temperature for 1 h . After washing , Flouroshield mounting media with DAPI ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) was added to stain the nuclei of all cells . After which , coverslips were mounted and the slides were observed under a microscope ( EVOS Cell Imaging Systems ; Life Technologies ) . 25 . In addition , Vero , SK - N - SH or U87 - MB cells were grown on four - chamber tissue culture treated glass slides and infected at MOI of 0 . 01 with ZIKV - MR766 or PR209 that were preincubated with / without RM immune sera ( 1 : 200 ) , and stained at 4 days post ZIKV infection using pan - flavivirus antibody as described . 17 Histopathology analysis For histopathology , formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded brain tissue was sectioned into 5 \u03bcm thick sagittal sections , placed on Superfrost microscope slides ( Fisher Scientific , Hampton , NH , USA ) and backed at 37 \u00b0 C overnight . The sections were deparaffinised using two changes of xylene and rehydrated by immersing in 100 % , 90 % and then 70 % ethanol . The sections were stained for nuclear structures using Harris haematoxylin ( Surgipath , Buffalo Grove , IL , USA ) for 2 min followed by differentiation in 1 % acid alcohol ( Surgipath ) and treatment with Scott ' s tap water for 2 min . Subsequently , the sections were counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin ( Surgipath ) for 2 min . The slides were dehydrated with 70 % , 90 % and 100 % ethanol , cleared in xylene and mounted using Permount ( Fisher Scientific ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 560}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
