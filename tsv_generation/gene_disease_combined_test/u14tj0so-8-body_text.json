These methods trade off run - time complexity and the generality of the class of structures they can predict . For example , the most general algorithm of Rivas and Eddy [ 33 ] , whose running time is ( n 6 ) on inputs of length n , is not practical for RNA sequences of length more than 100 nucleotides . This has been the main reason for development of heuristic methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] . Although heuristic methods may not find the MFE structure , they usually run faster than the MFE - based methods that handle the same class of structures . For example , HotKnots V2 . 0 [ 36 , 41 ] is a heuristic approach that uses carefully trained energy parameters , is guided by energy minimization and can handle kissing hairpin structures . However , HotKnots is still slow on long sequences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
