Here , we report that geranylated flavonoids are novel inhibitors targeting bacterial sialidase . These compounds show striking competitive inhibitory effects against sialidase from C . perfringens ( Cp - NanI ) . Importantly , C . perfringens is a human pathogen causing various gastrointestinal diseases such as enterotoxaemia , gas gangrene and peritonitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 257}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
