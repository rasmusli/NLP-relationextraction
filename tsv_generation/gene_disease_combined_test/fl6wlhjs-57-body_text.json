A plot of the actual specificity ( the specificity calculated using the training data ) minus the nominal specificity ( 1 - \u03b1 ) for different values of \u03b1 using a linear filter , for four different models . The value of the detection threshold \u03c4 k , \u03b1 , was calculated using a normal approximation . Receiver operating characteristic curves for the four models Figure 9 Receiver operating characteristic curves for the four models . Receiver operating characteristic curves ( averaged over 500 simulations of an anthrax outbreak ) for the detection of the anthrax outbreak signature in the chest radiographs at each of the five metropolitan children ' s hospitals using the four different models . The linear filter is used in each case . MinnStPaul varied across the five EDs studied ( Figure 6 ) . The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity also varied by the ED ( Figures 6 and 7 ) . The 1 - day filter , while closely matching the nominal specificity , performed poorly in terms of maximizing the sensitivity to detect an outbreak signature . The 7 - day filter , by smoothing over the outbreak signature ( Figure 5 ) , maximized the sensitivity , but at a compromise to the actual specificity obtained ( Figures 6 and 7 ) . The linear and exponential filters provided a balance between the specificity and sensitivity . Detection using our covariate - based seasonal time series model performed well across all EDs compared with fixed - effects regression models or time series models that omitted seasonal terms and / or covariates ( Figures 8 and 9 ) . denotes the one - step ahead prediction for the SARIMA process and { b k , 1 , . . . , b k , m } are obtained from the solution of the set of m linear equations :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 947}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
