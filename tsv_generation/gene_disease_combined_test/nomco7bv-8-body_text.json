However , within one symptom category at least one month without this specific infection was required to call it a new episode . We also calculated a monthly diary RTI score , averaging the ten RTI symptom categories with the coding \" 0 \" for \" no infection reported \" , \" 1 \" for \" reported infection with duration < 2 weeks \" , and \" 2 \" for \" reported infection present with duration > 2 weeks \" . Missing values for individual infection items were treated as zero . If an individual RTI symptom was reported , but information on duration was missing , it was counted as \" reported infection with duration < 2 weeks \" . If all items were missing , no diary score was computed . The diary RTI score at the monthly level was expanded to a score at the seasonal level by averaging over the six months ( November - April ) of each season , and to an overall score at the individual level by averaging over all available months . The respective upper 10 % of these diary scores within each month , season and overall served as additional outcome indicators .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 354}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
