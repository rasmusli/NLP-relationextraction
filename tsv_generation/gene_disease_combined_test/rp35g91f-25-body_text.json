Pair - wise comparisons were performed using a matrix function . All probe pairs within this set of 24 transcripts were positively correlated ( Figure S1 in File S1 ) . All pairs had a Pearson correlation . 0 . 5 with the exception of Myl4 and Doc2G ( 0 . 486 ) , and Myl4 and Rbm20 ( 0 . 495 ) . Further , heat - map analysis of eQTL for all 24 transcripts highlighted prominent regions of shared covariance on Chr1 and 2 with possible minor regions on Chr3 , Chr4 , Chr13 , and Chr17 ( Figure 2A ) . This suggested that expression levels of multiple transcripts in this gene network were coordinately regulated by a shared set of cis and trans eQTL .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
