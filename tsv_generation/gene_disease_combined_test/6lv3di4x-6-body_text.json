To confirm and further investigate the ability of JEV to infect porcine NEC from their apical side , we utilized well - differentiated ALI cultures established from porcine nasal mucosa . These experiments showed that both JEV strains infected cultures from the apical side , resulting in virus replication ( Fig . 2 ) . Again , the Laos strain showed statistically significantly higher levels of viral RNA than the Nakayama strain . Despite that , the two JEV strains tested displayed similar replication profiles , reaching a maximum at 72 hpi ( Fig . 2A ) . To test for apical and / or basolateral live virus shedding upon infection , we collected basolateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC . The results demonstrate that JEV was apically shed after infection with both JEV strains ( Fig . 2B ) . Interestingly , similar JEV titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts ( Fig . 2C ) , supporting the idea that infection of epithelial cells could result in a systemic infection . With respect to RNA levels , the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system . At 72 hpi , as shown in Fig . 2D , we visualized JEV infection of NEC by labeling of virus ( E protein , green ) , nuclei ( 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride [ DAPI ] , dark blue ) , tight junctions ( ZO - 1 , light blue ) , and cilia ( [UNK] - tubulin , red ) . While we observed mainly isolated E protein - positive cells for the Nakayama strain , the Laos strain led to the formation of clusters of E protein - positive cells ( Fig . 2D ) and colocalization of E protein and [UNK] - tubulin signals , suggesting replication in ciliated epithelial cells ( Fig . 2E ) . Porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 10 5 TCID 50 / sample for 2 h , followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h . In panel A , nuclei were stained with DAP ( blue ) , cilia with anti - \u2424 - tubulin ( red ) , and JEV with anti - E protein 4G2 ( green ) . The scale bar represents 10 m . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy . In panel B , a higher magnification of panel A is shown . In panel C , viral RNA was quantified by real - time RT - PCR . Results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle and are represented as 25 to 75 % interquartile boxes showing the mean and 95 % confidence intervals . Different superscript letters indicate significant difference ( P \u0545 0 . 05 ) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain ( letters without or with apostrophe for JEV Laos and Nakayama strain , respectively ) ; significant differences between distinct JEV strains at the same time postinfection are shown by an asterisk .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 443, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
