It is a statistical method that performs linear mapping to extract optimal features from an input distribution in the mean squared error sense and can be used by self - organizing neural networks to form unsupervised neural preprocessing modules for classification problems [ 6 ] . In order to minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage , each ORF is represented as a 59 - dimensional vector . Each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon excluding Met , Trp and three stop codons . Linear regression analysis was used to find the correlation between codon usage bias and gene length . Correlation analysis is used to identify the relationship between codon usage bias and synonymous codon usage pattern . This analysis is implemented based on the Spearman ' s rank correlation analysis way .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 543}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
