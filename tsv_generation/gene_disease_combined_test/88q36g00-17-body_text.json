Intrauterine inflammation activates fetal microglia during the acute phase , and subsequently , microglia also activate astrocytes . In the chronic phase , microglial activation is attenuated , while astrocytes are continuously activated 29 . Both microglia and astrocytes are important for normal neurodevelopment , however under prenatal inflammation , they are activated , their function is altered , and they have an adverse effect on neurons and axons , with the overproduction of pro - inflammatory cytokines 34 . Inflammation also prevents the maturation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells , followed by a reduction of the oligodendrocyte lineage 71 , 72 . This reduction leads to axonal loss . The neuronal and axonal damage caused by microglia or astrocytes in the developing brain would result in the abnormal behavioral features in later life . In our model , we have previously reported over - activation of fetal microglia 8 h after the LPS insult 12 , and the present study demonstrated that activation of astrocytes continued even ~ 5 weeks after the insult . Moreover , the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes were reduced in the amygdala and white matter , respectively . We have previously reported that H 2 has a suppressive effect on microglial activation 12 , and the present study demonstrated that H 2 had a similar effect on astrocytes , as described above . From these findings , we speculate that H 2 would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes indirectly via suppression of the over - activation of immune cells , including microglia and astrocytes , which would result in a reduction of the behavioral abnormalities present in MIA offspring . However , in this study , a direct effect of H 2 on neurons and oligodendrocytes was not evaluated in vitro , thus , this possibility cannot be excluded .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
