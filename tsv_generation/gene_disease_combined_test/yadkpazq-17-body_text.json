The treatments were distributed in equal portions bilaterally in axillary and inguinal regions . Heparinized blood was collected at time points 0 h ( just before injection of the treatment ) , 8 h , 24 h , 48 h , 96 h and 192 h . The cats were clinically examined and body temperature was measured at each time point . Whole blood samples were used in part for the assessment of hematological paramaters with the Sysmex XT 2000iV ( Sysmex , Norderstedt , Germany ) as previously described [ 57 ] . The rest of the blood was mixed with mRNA lysis buffer ( Roche Diagnostics ) immediately upon blood collection and processed as recommended by the manufacturer . Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood samples for 10 min at 1500 \u00d7 g and conserved at \u2212 80 \u00b0 C until use for in vitro experiments . Mx mRNA expression was measured by qPCR and normalized to the expression of two feline housekeeping genes as described above . The expression factors depicted in the figures represent the ratio of mRNA levels from a specific time point to mRNA levels from time point 0 h . For viral inhibition assays , the plasma collected from each cat at each time point was incubated for 24 h with fcwf - 4 cells prior to their inoculation with FCV . The assays were carried out as described above and viral inhibition factors were calculated as follows :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 984}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
