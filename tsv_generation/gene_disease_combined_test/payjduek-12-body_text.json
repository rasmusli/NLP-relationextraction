Echocardiography at 2 and 10 weeks after discharge were normal . A review of the investigation results from the regional laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of measles , with measles virus isolated from the patient ' s throat swab and measles - specific antibodies ( IgM ) present in the serum . Isolation of measles virus from the throat swab was performed using Vero / hSLAM cell lines . Typical cytopathic effect was observed as formation of syncytia , which appeared as large multinucleated cells ( giant cells ) . The cultures were then harvested and the presence of measles virus confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay ( Chemicon International , Temecula , USA ) . Measles - specific antibodies ( IgM ) in the serum were detected by an indirect enzyme linked immuno - sorbent assay ( ELISA ) using a commercially available test kit ( Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH , Marburg , Germany ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
