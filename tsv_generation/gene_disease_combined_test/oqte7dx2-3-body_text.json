Ubiquitination of a growing list of pre - and postsynaptic proteins can regulate their stability , function and subcellular localization ( Mabb and Ehlers , 2010 ; Bingol and Sheng , 2011 ; Kowalski and Juo , 2012 ) . The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on target proteins is catalyzed by a sequence of enzymatic reactions mediated by E1 ubiquitin - activating enzymes , E2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases ( Hershko and Ciechanover , 1998 ) . Ubiquitin itself has seven lysine residues and a primary amine at its N - terminus that can be utilized to form ubiquitin chains . Monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination , using various chain - linkage types , create distinct structural topologies that are recognized by ubiquitin binding proteins that mediate the various functions of ubiquitin . For example , Lys48 - and Lys11 - linked polyubiquitination result in proteasomal degradation , whereas Lys63 - linked polyubiquitination is typically associated with signaling and endo - lysosomal trafficking ( Piper and Lehner , 2011 ; Clague et al . , 2012 ; Nathan et al . , 2013 ) . Ubiquitin can be removed from substrates by proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) . The human genome encodes approximately 100 DUBs that are categorized into six families . The ubiquitin - specific proteases ( USPs ) make up the largest family , comprised of 54 cysteine proteases ( Nijman et al . , 2005 ; Mevissen and Komander , 2017 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 261}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
