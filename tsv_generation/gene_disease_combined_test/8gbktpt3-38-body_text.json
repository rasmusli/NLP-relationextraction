X55115 ) . The evolutionary relationships with FPV 193 / 70 cannot be inferred reliably , since the isolate , obtained from a 3 - month - old cat in Melbourne with peracute fatal FPL , had been serially passaged in vitro before sequencing in 1990 . Interestingly , FPV 193 / 70 falls notably close to a clade of vaccine viruses in our analysis . In addition , we generated the VP2 sequence of an FPV strain detected in a healthy feral cat from Tasmania in 2010 , which was genetically distinct from outbreak strains in this study and also fell into clade D , suggesting a vaccine - related origin . These findings , together with a report of FPV detection in the bone marrow of a healthy feral cat from Melbourne in 2012 [ 25 ] , provide evidence that FPV has been circulating widely in Australia , at least since the 1970s , although the viruses are phylogenetically unrelated to the 2015 - 2018 outbreaks .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
