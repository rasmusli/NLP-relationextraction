Human Neu1 - 4 protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI database ( Neu1 , NM _ 000434 . 2 ; Neu2 , NM _ 005383 . 2 ; Neu3 , NM _ 006656 . 5 ; Neu4 , NM _ 001167599 . 1 ) . On the basis of the Neu2 sequence and structure ( PDB entry 1vcu ; Chavas et al . , 2005 ) , multiple sequence alignment and structure - based alignment were performed using ClustalX2 ( Larkin et al . , 2007 ) and MODELLER 9v7 align2d ( Sali & Blundell , 1993 ; Supplementary Fig . S1 1 ) . Regions from Neu1 , Neu3 and Neu4 that are not conserved in the Neu2 catalytic domain ( Neu1 residues 1 - 64 , Neu3 residues 1 - 11 , 287 - 300 and 315 - 326 and Neu4 residues 1 - 10 , 284 - 336 and 355 - 373 ) were excluded . Modelling was carried out for the human Neu1 , Neu3 and Neu4 catalytic domains against the chosen Neu2 template ( PDB entry 1vcu ) using MODELLER 9v7 modelsingle ( Sali & Blundell , 1993 ; Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Each of ten outputs of the modelled structures was ranked using an internal scoring function in MODELLER 9v7 . The reliability of the homology modelling was assessed by calculating the root - mean - square deviation ( r . m . s . is the intensity of reflection hkl , P hkl is the sum over all reflections and P i is the sum over i measurements of reflection hkl . \u2021 R work = P hkl jF obs j \u00c0 jF calc j = P hkl jF obs j | ; R free is the R value calculated for 5 % of the data set that was not included in the refinement .
