Our results demonstrate that G0 / G1 arrest promotes EV - D68 replication and increases viral virulence without affecting virus entry . We also assessed the effects of S phase and G2 / M phase synchronization on viral production . Our results suggest that S phase synchronization does not affect viral entry , replication or production compared to the control treatment , while G2 / M synchronization inhibits viral replication and decreases viral virulence , but does not affect virus entry . These results indicate that G0 / G1 phase is most favorable for EV - D68 replication , that S phase can support some viral production , and that G2 / M phase is inhibitory for host viral production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
