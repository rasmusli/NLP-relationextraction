It has been shown that interaction between eEF1A and the 3 1 - terminal stem - loop of the WNV genomic RNA facilitates the viral minus - strand RNA synthesis [ 30 , 36 , 37 ] . In the present study , we demonstrated that eEF1A binds to IRES located in the 5 1 - UTR of CSFV . Whether eEF1A binds to 3 1 - UTR of CSFV and influences RNA replication requires further study . We showed that eEF1A inhibits CSFV growth and reduces IRES activity of CSFV . Thus , we speculate that eEF1A affects the process of the viral protein translation via interacting with the CSFV IRES .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 12}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
