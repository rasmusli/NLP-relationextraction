In the second case ( GenBank - formatted files ) , gene calling is optional , since GenBank - formatted files already include the coordinates for open - reading frames and RNA genes . In the last case ( Entrez ID or Genome Project ID ) , the tools provided within the RAST Submission / Retrieval Server will query NCBI using the query ID ( s ) and will retrieve the sequence ( whether that sequence consists of one or a set of contigs that make up the genome project ) ; that sequence then becomes the input to the RAST Server .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 72}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
