We refer to a secondary structure with crossing base pairs as a pseudoknotted secondary structure and a secondary structure with no crossing base pairs as a pseudoknot - free secondary structure ( see Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 shows different kinds of loops in a secondary structure . We refer the readers to Jabbari et al . [ 48 ] or Rastegari et al . [ 56 ] for precise definition and illustration of terms used in the figure . Figure 1 Pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free secondary structures . Examples of loops and canonical base pairs in a pseudoknotted and a pseudoknot - free secondary structure . The blue base pairs belong to the G big structure and the green base pairs belong to the G small structure , as defined in Section ' Definition of G big and G small ' .
