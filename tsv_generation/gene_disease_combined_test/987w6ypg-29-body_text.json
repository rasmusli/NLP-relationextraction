Normalized NL4 - 3 Env bearing HIV - 1 virions produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs were bound to HeLaP4 cells at 4 \u00b0 C prior to extensive cell washing . The temperature was then raised at 37 \u00b0 C to induce entry . The extent of entry was then measured according to the two assays schematically depicted in A . B ) Two hours after entry , cells were extensively washed , treated with trypsin to remove external virion particles and then lysed . The amount of cell - associated p24 was measured by ELISA . C ) After exo - RT normalization , equal amounts of viruses incorporating Vpr - BLAM were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells for 2 hours . Cells were then incubated with the fluorescent dye CCF2 prior to FACS analysis .
