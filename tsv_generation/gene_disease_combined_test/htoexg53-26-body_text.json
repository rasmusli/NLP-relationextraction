These mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the MERS - CoV S protein as an important vaccine antigen for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies [ 23 , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] 54 ] . Moreover , BALB / c mice transduced with the human cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( hDPP4 ) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive MERS - CoV lung infection , which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of MERS - CoV - specific immunization using the MERS - CoV S protein [ 24 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 ] . Here , we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an MVA - delivered MERS - CoV N antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice . In general , the N protein is a well conserved internal protein and the major structural component incorporating the viral RNA within the viral nucleocapsid [ 55 ] . In previous studies , the SARS - CoV N protein has also been used as candidate antigen for vaccine development [ 56 ] , and an experimental DNA vaccine efficiently induced SARS - CoV N - specific cellular immunity [ 57 , 58 ] . In line with this data , recent studies in MERS patients demonstrated that both antibody and T cell responses are associated with recovery from MERS - CoV infection [ 59 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 124}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
