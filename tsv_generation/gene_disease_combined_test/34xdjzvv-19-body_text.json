Investigation of the affinity of N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity . We have identified that N3 specifically recognized a VP1 epitope ( 210 - 225 amino acid of VP1 region or named 776 - 790 encoded residues of EV71 genome ; [ 17 ] ) . In comparison of the recent study [ 37 ] , alignment of the highly conserved region of VP1 amino acid ( 200 - 225 ) sequences from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71 , which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross - neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence . The epitope recognized by N3 is also different from the previous report ' s epitopes ; the mouse anti - sera generated from the peptides , P230 - 323 , P646 - 755 , P857 - 1012 and P1329 - 1440 , showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medulla . N3 only closely met with the peptide P746 - 876 which elicits weak cross - reactivity to human tissues [ 38 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
