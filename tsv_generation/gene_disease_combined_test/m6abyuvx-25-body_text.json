These pathological findings in the transgenic mice were very similar to those in humans with chronic hepatitis C ; therefore , this mouse model of HCV may be useful for analyzing the immune response to chronic hepatitis . However , experimental results obtained with this mouse model may not directly translate to clinical findings from patients with HCV infection because the expression of HCV proteins was not liver specific in these mice . Furthermore , poly ( I : C ) injection can activate innate immune responses and , consequently , might induce temporary liver injury [ 18 ] . Additionally , poly ( I : C ) injection has an adjuvant effect ; specifically , it stimulates TLR3 signaling [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 30}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
