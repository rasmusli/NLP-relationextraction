This sequence was missing the last 480 nucleotides of segment 4 . We amended this by appending the ending sequence of another 1918 H1N1 virus , A / South Carolina / 1 / 18 ( H1N1 ) . These two strains had only one nucleotide difference in the ORF of segment 4 ( C / T at position 238 ) . Thus , they are essentially identical and we do not expect to have introduced extra mutations in this way .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 166}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
