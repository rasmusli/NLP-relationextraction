Protein Prospector score thresholds were selected with a minimum protein score of 15 and minimum peptide score of 10 . Maximum expectation values of 0 . 01 and 0 . 05 were used for protein and peptide matches , respectively . Substrate specificity profiles were generated with iceLogo software 18 using all possible cleavages in the MSP - MS library ( n = 2 , 964 ) as the negative data set as described 16 . MS1 extracted ion chromatograms for label - free quantitation of select substrate and product species were generated using Skyline software ( v . 3 . 5 , University of Washington ) 34 . Specificity constants ( k cat / K m ) were calculated as described 16 . All raw spectrum ( . RAW ) files from MSP - MS experiments in this study are available at the ProteoSafe resource ( ftp : / / MSV000080171 @ massive . ucsd . edu / ; username MSV000080171 , password : hAPN ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
