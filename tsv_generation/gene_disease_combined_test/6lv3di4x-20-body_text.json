This led us to investigate the potential next step for the establishment of a systemic infection , which could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area . In fact , MDM were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by IL - 4 polarization . This is relevant , as such a polarization could also be induced following JEV infection of NEC through the release of alarmins , such as IL - 33 , IL - 25 , and TSLP , from stressed and dying epithelial cells ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 ) . These alarmins are known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL - 4 and IL - 13 , which promote M2 - like macrophage polarization ( 62 ) ( 63 ) ( 64 ) ( 65 ) . In fact , our data indicate that supernatants from infected porcine NEC cultures contained factors which further enhanced infection of macrophages . We also demonstrated that these alarmins can enhance JEV infection of macrophages , further supporting this concept .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
