Three to five day - old female mosquitoes ( n = 40 ) were blood - fed on chicken skin membranes with WNV ( 1 . 13 \u00d7 10 ^ 6 pfu / ml ) or 199 medium ( as control ) and the mosquitoes were incubated at 25 \u00b0 C and 65 % humidity in an environmental cabinet ( Thermoline Scientific , Smithfield , Australia ) with a wet cotton pad ( 10 % sucrose solution ) provided daily as a food source . At 24 hpi , surviving females were collected for analysis . For this , mosquito midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead - beater . RNA extracted using the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) by pooling four samples and was used for realtime RT - qPCR as described above .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
