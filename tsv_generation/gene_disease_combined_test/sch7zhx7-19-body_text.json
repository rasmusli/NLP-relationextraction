We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible , with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 \u00b5M and an IC50 value of 70 . 9 \u00b5M . In contrast , virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment , with an IC50 value of 293 \u00b5M , suggesting developing resistance to DFMO . Following passage of virus , RNA was extracted , purified , reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced . When the sequenced virus was aligned with the parental CVB3 genome , mutations in the two viral proteases , 2A ( Q29K ) and 3C ( Q52R ) , were observed . Interestingly , these mutations were observed independently in three distinct viral lineages . Further , the 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutations were not observed in the same lineage . Importantly , no mutations were observed in viruses passaged without treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 799}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
