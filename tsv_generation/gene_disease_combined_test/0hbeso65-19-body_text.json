Antihepatitis B immunoglobulin had been approved to successfully prevent HBV recurrence after LT . It is used in antibody therapy for HCV - infected recipients . However , recent studies using hepatitis C immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibody show only transient decrease of liver HCV RNA levels in liver transplant recipients [ 62 , 63 ] . Preemptive or early posttransplant antiviral therapy aims to prevent the rapid development of chronic hepatitis before there is evidence of recurrent HCV infection . It is usually initiated within one month after LT . Compared to immunocompetent subjects , antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression . A pilot study by Mazzaferro collected 36 HCV - RNA + cirrhotic patients who started a 12 - month IFN plus RBV combination therapy within 3 weeks after LT [ 64 ] . The sustained virological response ( SVR ) was achieved in 33 % of patients . None of the patients developed graft rejection , and normal histology was also noted in patients with SVR after a median followup of 52 months . However , higher than 26 % of graft rejection was noted in another study using IFN and RBV combination therapy for more than 12 months [ 65 ] . Moreover , four other studies using different regiments , two IFN monotherapy and two pegylated - IFN monotherapy , showed a poor effect of less than 20 % of SVR and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation and graft rejection [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] . Therefore , more prospective and large - scaled studies are still needed to investigate the most appropriate regimen for Preemptive treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 167}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
