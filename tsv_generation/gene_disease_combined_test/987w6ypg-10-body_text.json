The transfected DNAs coded the HIV - 1 Gag - Pol plus non - structural viral proteins , the indicated envelope , as well as a miniviral genome bearing a GFP expression cassette , except where a complete provirus was used , as indicated . Two days after transfection , supernatants were pre - cleared by centrifugation at low speed , then by filtration through a 0 , 45 \u03bcm syringe filter and were lastly purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25 % sucrose cushion . Under these conditions , expression of IFITMs induced only a minor defect of virus production , as quantified by exogenous - RT activity ( exo - RT , Additional file 1 : Figure S1A ) . To focus solely on the infectivity defect of retrieved viral particles , virions were normalized by exo - RT and then used to challenge either HeLaP4 cells stably expressing the HIV receptor / co - receptor CD4 / CXCR4 , prior to flow cytometry 3 days afterwards ( a typical FACS profile is presented in Figure 1B ) . Virions produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity over wild type ones ( 70 % to 75 % reduction over a single round infection assay , Figure 1C , left graph ) . To determine whether this defect could be observed using a WT HIV - 1 clone ( NL4 - 3 , a widely used proviral clone ) , the same experimental system was used on viruses produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with NL4 - 3 and IFITMs . Upon exo - RT normalization , virions were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells and viral infectivity was measured by \u03b2 - galactosidase assay ( MAGI ) 24 hours afterwards , taking advantage of the HIV - 1 - LTR - \u03b2 - Gal reporter stably integrated in these cells ( Figure 1C , right graph ) . Under these conditions , IFITMs imparted a similar infectivity defect to produced viruses ( from 70 to 90 % reduction for the different IFITMs ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 128}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
