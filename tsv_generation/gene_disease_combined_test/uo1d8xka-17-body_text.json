All twelve core sequences are mapped to the Thai clade . Besides these twelve , ten more sequences were found in this clade , whereby eight of them are fragments . The remaining two are actually complete sequences from Thailand ( chicken isolates ) . However , they were annotated as Neuramindase instead of Neuraminidase [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] which explains why these two entries are missing in the core set . However , querying of Uniprot with \" Influenza virus \" and \" NA \" as query terms has returned these two entries which are clearly captured and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis . Zooming out of the Thai clade has shown the Vietnam clade as its nearest neighbor , followed further by the Indian clade with Vietnam strains as their neighbors . On the next higher level Indonesian , Malaysian and Chinese clades are indicated as neighbors . It would be interesting to further study the Indian clade and verify how closely the Indian strains and Vietnamese strains are related with respect to other genes and also at genome level . Such an analysis may lead to the identification of the origin for Bird Flu in India . Further analysis of the large dataset indicates H9N2 as the nearest clade to H5N1 and non - structural protein as nearest to NA within the H5N1 _ NA group . The overall tree includes isolates from H3N2 to H15N9 . A detailed analysis of each clade and sub - clade within this tree and with reference to the other two trees could lead to an understanding of H5N1 ' s molecular evolution at global level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 448}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
