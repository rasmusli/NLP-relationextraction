The studied demographic and lifestyle variables ( age , gender , education level , smoking status , contact to children , asthma , sports activity , dietary patterns and previous removal of immune organs ) did only marginally affect ORs . However , adjustment for asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) or a summary score covering all queried co - morbidities weakened the relationship between obesity and all outcomes considerably . Adjustment for vitamin D levels among those for which serum was available ( n = 508 ) , had only a slight effect on the magnitude of the association between obesity and RTI outcomes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
