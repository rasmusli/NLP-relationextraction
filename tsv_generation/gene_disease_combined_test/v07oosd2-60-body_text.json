However , it is difficult to identify a single \" ideal \" solution for PWD management . Also , as was discussed above , PWD is a multifactorial disease and the exact overall etiology has not yet been fully elucidated , making it difficult to choose suitable alternatives . Moreover , the most of these alternatives produce inconsistent results regarding their effectiveness in field conditions [ 107 ] . Oral administration of specificantibody - containing egg yolk , or SDP to weaned piglets showed in some cases no protection against ETEC strains or PWD outcomes , likely because the contained antibodies were not specific against the infecting ETEC strains present on the farm [ 2 ] . The composition of plant extracts , organic acids and probiotics is complex and knowledge regarding their mechanisms of action is poor , resulting in variable results and safety risks [ 87 ] . Synergy mechanisms of probiotics and prebiotics are not very well known nor well studied [ 133 ] . Although AMPs and bacteriophages helped in the treatment of PWD , the bacterial resistance risk , the high cost and the narrow antibacterial spectrum of these alternatives reduce their practical use on farms [ 88 ] . Vaccination is one of the most promising strategies for the control of PWD in pigs both in terms of preventive ability and cost - effectiveness [ 97 ] . The control of production parameters ( temperature , ventilation , density , sanitation , biosafety , improvement of feed quality ) are crucial factors for the control of PWD and the reduction of the use of antimicrobials during the post - weaning period [ 28 ] . However , the improvement of farm conditions and management requires investment and awareness of pig farmers . Furthermore , the use of regular diagnostic testing is crucial to ensure an appropriate choice of the antimicrobial and to monitor its effectiveness on farms . Thus , efforts to improve microbiological laboratory detection methods are of paramount importance to help the veterinarian to act rapidly at an early stage of the disease [ 153 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
