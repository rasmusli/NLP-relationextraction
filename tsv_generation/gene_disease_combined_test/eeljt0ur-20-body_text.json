Cats with a positive status were included within this study population , receiving dietary intervention alone . Similar to a previous report ( 15 ) , a positive status did not correlate with the occurrence of vomiting or diarrhea over the study period . It should be emphasized that the presence of FCoV antibody and C . perfringens toxin gene does not necessarily denote infection nor does it indicate the need to initiate medical therapy . Similarly , antimicrobial therapy for Campylobacter spp . is not recommended in animals that are not immunocompromised or showing systemic signs of illness ( fever , hemorrhagic diarrhea , abnormal leukogram findings ) as it can prolong the carrier state and the diarrhea typically selfresolves with supportive care alone ( 16 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
