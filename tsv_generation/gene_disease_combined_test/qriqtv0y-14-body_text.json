The reference nucleotide sequences of CaKoVs were retrived based on their different geographic locations , host species and date of isolation . Phylogenetic analysis of CaKoV was performed by using MEGA v . 6 . 0 ( Tempe , AZ , USA ) [ 29 ] with neighbor - joining method with Kimura 2 - parameter with 1 , 000 bootstrap replicates and Beast program with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ( BMCMC ) with 10 , 000 , 000 generations and an average standard deviation of split frequencies < 0 . 05 [ 30 ] . For genetic analysis , the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acids of CaKoV were aligned and compared using MegAlign software v . 5 . 03 ( DNASTAR Inc . ; Wisconsin , USA ) . Pairwise comparison of nucleotides and amino acids of Thai CaKoV and those of reference CaKoVs were conducted . The variable and unique amino acids related to receptor binding of the viruses and host preferences of CaKoVs were monitored .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
