Categorical variables were compared using the chi - square test or Fisher ' s exact test as appropriate . Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves were constructed to determine the performances of BAL fluid cellular components , serum procalcitonin concentration , and C - reactive protein concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia . Youden ' s Index ( sensitivity + specificity - 1 ) [ 18 ] was used to select the optimal cutoff points of the ROC curve . Area under the curve ( AUC ) , sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were calculated . For positiveand negative predictive values , the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in severe pneumonia patients admitted to the medical ICU was assumed to be 35 . 9 % , based on our previous study [ 14 ] . Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of bacterial pneumonia . Variables with P values less than 0 . 2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis . The correlation between BAL fluid white blood cell ( WBC ) count and APACHE II score was determined by calculating Pearson ' s correlation coefficient . Significance was accepted at P # 0 . 05 . All tests were performed using SPSS ( version 18 . 0 ; SPSS , Inc . ) and GraphPad Prism ( version 5 ; GraphPad , Inc . ) software . pneumonia underwent bronchoscopic BAL ( 67 with CAP , 159 with HCAP , and 133 with HAP ) . Of these patients , 100 were excluded because the pathogen was not identified , 42 were excluded because BAL fluid analysis was not possible ( due to severe neutropenia or specimen clotting ) or not performed , 52 were excluded because two or more types of pathogens were identified , and 100 were excluded because they received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL . Ten patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia , 5 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis , and 3 patients with mycobacterial pneumonia were also excluded . Finally , 47 patients ( 24 with bacterial pneumonia and 23 with viral pneumonia ) were included .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 383}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
