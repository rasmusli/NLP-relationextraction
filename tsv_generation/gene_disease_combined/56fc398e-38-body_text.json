The TNS method proves significantly more effective than both the RMS and RNS methods when markets do not contribute to transmission - less than 20 % of all farms would need to be surveyed in order to predict epidemic sizes to within 90 % confidence in the UK for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria , Devon and Aberdeenshire . The model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease , the size of the epidemic peak and the epidemic duration . When markets contribute towards disease amplification , the TNS method requires that around 30 % of all nodes would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes . The SBS method is found to perform less effectively than the TNS method , as this strategy rapidly identifies the most highly connected nodes that are likely to contribute most significantly to disease transmission . However , the SBS method may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
