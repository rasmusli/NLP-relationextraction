A number of studies have noted lymphocytic infiltrates in samples from later timepoints . Limited studies have shown that acute infiltrates develop over time with late fibrosis occurring in the intima and adventia layers . Neutrophils seem to be the predominant initial cell infiltrate [ 80 ] . However , in a series of six specimens , neutrophil infiltration was quickly followed by lymphocyte infiltrates , then mixed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates were demonstrated later , near day 19 of illness [ 81 ] . In a separate series ( 8 specimens ) , early B lymphocyte infiltration after initial neutrophil infiltrate was confirmed [ 80 ] . Prominent nodular infiltrates , similar to atherosclerotic plaque formation , have also been described , but these appear to occur at later timepoints ( > 3 weeks ) . These infiltrates consisted of T cells , macrophages , B cells and prevalent IgM + plasma cells , with less frequent IgA + plasma cells . The authors compare these to similar B cell rich lesions driven by both superantigens and specific infectious antigens [ 82 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1180, "end": 1194}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1227}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 813, "end": 833}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 846, "end": 869}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
