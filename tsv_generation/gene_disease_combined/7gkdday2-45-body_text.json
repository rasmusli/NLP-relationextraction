Thirty - five out of 200 specimens remained undetected of any viral or bacterial pathogens . It is highly likely that the inclusion of fungal pathogen detection system and the addition of coronavirus in the viral panel would increase the rate of pathogen detection to some extent . In addition , the detection rate of bacterial pathogens could have been higher if PCR or qPCR had been used instead of culture method as the former one has higher sensitivity . However , we wanted to isolate all types of possible organisms and the use of specific primers would have confined the range of organisms . For example , E . agglomerans which has been rarely reported as a causative agent of ARIs was isolated in 4 ( 2 % ) nasal swab specimens in this study . The nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA ) has been considered to be the best sampling technique , but the procedure of obtaining an NPA specimen is uncomfortable and often frightening for young children . It is also unpleasant for the medical staff , who have to carry out the procedure with a struggling , crying , and coughing child . However , pathogen detection sensitivity did not differ significantly between nasal swab and NPA approaches of specimen collection when sensitive real - time PCR method was used to detect pathogens [ 58 , 59 ] . In the study , only those viruses that are frequently detected in Bangladesh were listed in the viral panel . Even with these limitations , the study provides important preliminary data that can be used for more focused surveys in a larger population . The frequency of viral infection should be taken into account by pediatricians to avoid the irrational use of antibiotics .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1825, "end": 1837}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1999, "end": 2015}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
