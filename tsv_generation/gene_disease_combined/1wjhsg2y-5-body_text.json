Yet a number of geographic regions lack coordinated bat research networks , most notably Western Asia [ 4 ] , a region of 20 countries extending from Turkey in the west , Georgia in the north , Yemen in the south , and Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east . Furthermore , most bat research networks are not integrated with the zoonotic disease or viral research communities . Given the potential of Western Asia as an emerging zoonotic disease hotspot [ 22 ] , and bat - associated zoonoses hotspot in particular [ 9 , 23 ] , surveillance initiatives focused on bat - associated viruses in Western Asia are warranted . In this review , we discuss the importance of collaboration between bat research networks and virus surveillance initiatives to understand the role of human activities in the transmission and spread of bat - associated viruses . We conduct a literature review to assess research effort on bats and bat - associated viruses around the world , and demonstrate that Western Asia constitutes a research gap , lacking an established bat research network and has limited published research on bats and their associated viruses . Lastly , we outline a new regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia ( i . e . , the Western Asia Bat Research Network , WAB - Net ) , with the unique aim of taking an integrated approach to untangle host - virus dynamics to find \" win - win \" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 495}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 595}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 616, "end": 642}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 738}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 997}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
