The Zika virus was thought to have been introduced to South America between May and December 2013 . During this time , there were three major international events held in Brazil - World Youth Day in July 2013 , the Fifa World Cup in 2014 , and the World Sprint Championship Canoe Race in Rio de Janeiro in 2014 - that may have been responsible for this introduction ( Possas 2016 ) . The World Sprint Championship Canoe Race in Rio de Janeiro was attended by a team from French Polynesia , where the Zika outbreak first occurred ( Possas 2016 ; Gautret and Simon 2016 ) . These types of mass gatherings attracting international travelers put attendees at greater risk for transmission of communicable diseases ( Gautret and Simon 2016 ; World Health Organization 2017b ) . Despite these risks , the WHO only advised pregnant women and women planning to get pregnant to avoid traveling to Zikaaffected regions but did not implement a travel ban ( Lima - Camara 2016 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 107}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 592, "end": 597}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 802}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
