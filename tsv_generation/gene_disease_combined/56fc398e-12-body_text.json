A directed weighted - static adjacency matrix A [ 38 ] was constructed for each set of sampled data , in which nodes represent farms and edges represent ( directed ) cattle movements . An edge a ij is defined to be non - zero if cattle are moved from farm i to farm j during the year . The weight of the edge represents the frequency of movements from farm i to farm j in 2010 ( i . e . the total number of days on which movements occurred divided by 365 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
