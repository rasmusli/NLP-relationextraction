While one must take care when making inference from a subnetwork to the full network [ 28 ] , it would be of great interest to the broader study of disease spread on partially observed networks to test these strategies further on livestock networks such as those available in other European countries [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] . The results of this work provide evidence of the viability of using partially sampled data to predict disease spread in livestock [ 21 ] and humans [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] , and will inform data collection strategies in situations where complete knowledge of the network is impossible ( e . g . wildlife movements [ 47 , 48 ] ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
