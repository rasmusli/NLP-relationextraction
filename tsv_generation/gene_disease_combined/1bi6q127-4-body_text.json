A host ' s defenses attempt to control virus infection but viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract them [ 13 ] . When the host defenses are suppressed , or if the virus is able to circumvent the host immune system , virus replication is enhanced , leading to an increase in virus shedding . The route of shedding is highly dependent on the tissue in which the virus replication occurs . For example , increased replication in the kidney would lead the bat to shed the virus in urine , whereas intestinal replication would result in dissemination through feces . Therefore , it becomes important to study what factors might be responsible for decreasing the host defense or factors that allow the virus to circumvent host immune response . But before exploring factors affecting virus - host interactions , it is imperative to understand the viruses present in bats and the bat immune defenses . In 2013 - 2014 , bat immunology was at a nascent stage and Schountz and Baker et al . [ 14 , 15 ] had summarized the preliminary knowledge about it in their reviews . In 2017 , Schountz et al . [ 16 ] again reviewed bat immunology but the article also laid out gaps in our understanding of host pathogen interactions in bats . Here , we include more recent advances in characterizing the bat immune system including a possible link between the evolution of flight in bats and viral persistence . Following that section , we discuss the factors identified so far that upset the balanced bat - virus relationship , potentially leading to the spillover of viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
