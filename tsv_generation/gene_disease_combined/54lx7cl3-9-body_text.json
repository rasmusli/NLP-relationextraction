A number of population studies suggest that S . pneumoniae carriage is positively associated with H . influenzae [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] and Moraxella catarrhalis [ 18 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] carriage but negatively associated with S . aureus [ 19 , 20 , [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] . Furthermore , S . aureus carriage is generally negatively associated with H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis [ 19 , 24 , 31 ] carriage , whereas H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis are believed to be positively associated [ 18 , 22 , 24 , 33 ] . Nevertheless , our understanding is limited , as the dynamics of niche competition likely consist of complex relationships between multiple species [ 31 , 34 ] and strains [ 15 , 35 ] , further influenced by host and environmental factors [ 22 , 36 ] . As carriage is an important precursor of respiratory infections for certain bacterial species [ 12 ] , unraveling the complex system of bacterial interactions that determine URT microbiota may be key factor for understanding the etiology of pneumonia .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 580}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 948}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 954}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1398, "end": 1421}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1598, "end": 1608}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
