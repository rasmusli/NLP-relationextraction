Categorical variables were summarized as number and percent ( % ) . Continuous variables were summarized as median and interquartile range ( IQR ) . To assess univariate associations of S . suis with potential risk factors in hospital controls , we used both logistic regression without any adjustment for covariates and with adjustment for sex , age , and living in a rural or urban area . We used conditional logistic regression for the matched community controls and these analyses were performed with and without additional adjustment for sex ( in addition to the matched variables age and place of living ) . In a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors of main interest , all potential risk factors plus the potential confounders ( e . g . age , sex , place of living ) were jointly included in a logistic ( hospital controls ) or conditional logistic ( community controls ) regression model . No model selection such as backwards elimination was performed . We included separate effects of exposure to pigs or pork depending on whether the individual had skin injuries or not . S . suis infection occurred predominantly in males but controls were not matched by gender . As a sensitivity analysis , we therefore repeated the multivariate analysis including only male cases and controls . All analyses were performed with Stata version 10 . 1 ( StataCorp ) software .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1166, "end": 1180}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1189, "end": 1198}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
