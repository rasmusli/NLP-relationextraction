Although the data required for such a task are often available from post hoc analyses of epidemics they are certainly lacking for a novel emerging infection . Instead , the uncertainty surrounding assumptions about the distributions should be incorporated into quantitative predictions made from epidemiological models , especially since this may well be greater than any uncertainty that arises from noise in the data . Of course , more sophisticated fitting methods than those used in this paper exist [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] , but if the underlying structure of the model is inappropriate , the method of parameterization is largely irrelevant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
