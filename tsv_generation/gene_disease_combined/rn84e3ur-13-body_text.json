In this approach , the governing equations of the carrier phase were numerically solved in the computational geometry based on the Eulerian framework [ 23 ] . Transient species transport model for water vapor was added to the Eulerian carrier phase models to represent the humidity in the air [ 23 ] . For the discrete phase , the governing equations were described in the Lagrangian framework . Each aerosol released from the injections point was tracked individually in the Lagrangian frame for its instantaneous position and velocity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
