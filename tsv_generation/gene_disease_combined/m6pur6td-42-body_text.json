Total carbon emissions including the fossil fuel combustion in the city ' s boundary and embodied in the imported electricity out of the boundary were still performing a rising tendency . Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou , especially after 2009 . Examining the effects of different boundaries on carbon accounting at city level is crucial for the emissions mitigation in urban China .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
