Several animal models have been developed to be EV71 infectious model using the mouse - adapted strain of EV71 [ 5 ] , innate immunodeficient mice [ 6 ] , or monkey models [ 7 ] . The intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection of clinical isolate of EV71 to adult mice caused no apparent clinical symptoms . Administration of mouse - adapted EV71 strain 4643 ( Tainan / 4643 / 98 ) to 1 - d - old ICR mice caused hind limb paralysis ( LP ) and death within 2 wk of the challenge [ 8 ] . Challenge of 1 - d - old BALB / C and ICR mice infected with EV71 YN3 strain was also lethal [ 5 ] . A deficiency in type I and type II IFN receptors of the AG129 mouse cause neurological manifestations after infection with the non - mouse adapted EV71 strain ( 5865 / SIN / 00009 ; [ 6 ] ) . The EV71 BrCr strain , an original prototype of the genotype A strain from California [ 9 ] , was demonstrated to induce neurological manifestations of tremor , ataxia , and brain edema , but no pulmonary edema ( PE ) and cardiac failure in cynomolgus monkeys [ 7 ] . These models are not perfect for HFMD or for neuropathogenesis caused by EV71 . Viral pathogenesis in mouseadapted EV71 - infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection and exhibit the restricted timeframe ( up to one week old of mouse age ) allowing for pathogenic challenge of EV71 . In addition , innate immunity , particularly type I IFN , involved for the EV71 - induced pathogenic phenotype was reported [ 10 , 11 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 792}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1549, "end": 1560}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 588}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 593}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 845}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1084}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1094}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1121}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1130, "end": 1146}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1148, "end": 1151}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1157, "end": 1173}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1236, "end": 1241}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
