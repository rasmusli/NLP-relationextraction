As we have described in result section , our in vitro antibiotic resistance patterns were concerning in the sense that most of the isolates except S . pneumaniae , such as K . pneumaniae , Streptococcus species , H . influenzae , and E . agglomerans exhibited alarming levels of resistance against the majority of available first line of antibiotics . Even two of 15 multidrug - resistant isolates ( K . pneumaniae and E . agglomerans ) displayed resistance not only against all the first - line of antibiotics but also against all the second - line of antibiotics . Despite the advances in therapeutic and preventive measures , the emerging resistance to the antibiotics is a growing concern among clinicians and other health professionals worldwide . The indiscriminate and unreasonable use of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of resistance , which may turn out to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing countries . A tailored antibiotic treatment is in demand to tackle this major issue , but the dearth of information regarding the etiological agents and antibiotic sensitivity patterns in countries like Bangladesh have made it difficult . The information regarding antibiotic resistance patterns provided here in this study is expected to raise alertness among physicians , community people , as well as among policy makers of public and private sectors in the country .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 95}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
