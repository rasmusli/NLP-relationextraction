Questions were not planned in an inflexible manner . The questions were not asked in a pre - arranged sequence , but the researcher ensured that all relevant topics were covered and that the research focus was kept in mind . The researcher also asked probing questions to guide participants to elaborate further upon their responses where additional information were required or where unclear answers required more clarity . This resulted in gaining in - depth accounts about participants ' experiences while caring for TB patients . Data was collected by means of audio - recordings , field notes , and in - depth interviews .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 689, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
