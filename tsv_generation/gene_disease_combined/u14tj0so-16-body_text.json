In contrast , one of the best heuristic methods , HotKnots V2 . 0 , takes 1 . 7 hours and 91 GB of memory for a sequence with 400 nucleotides . Therefore our method is practical for prediction of long RNA structures . Iterative HFold bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average accuracy of pseudoknotted structures of the HK - PK data set is significantly higher than that of IPknot , ( ( 72 . 83 % , 83 . 37 % ) vs . ( 54 . 56 % , 66 . 25 % ) ) and is comparable to that of HotKnots V2 . 0 , ( vs . ( 73 . 60 % , 83 . 35 % ) ) two of the best prediction methods available . Iterative HFold ' s accuracy is significantly higher than that of IPknot and HotKnots on our IP - pk168 data set . Iterative HFold also has higher accuracy than HFold even when just partial information about the true pseudoknot - free structure is provided , so it is more robust than HFold . Specifically , Iterative HFold ' s average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from roughly 54 % to 79 % as the user provides up to 40 % of the input structure , and improves with a more modest but still positive improvement in accuracy when further structural information is provided .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 956, "end": 963}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 976}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1238, "end": 1263}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
