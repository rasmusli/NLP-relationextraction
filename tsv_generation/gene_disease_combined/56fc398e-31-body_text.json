In Devon , only 3 % of the nodes require sampling for the TNS method to predict epidemic sizes at 6 weeks , compared with 10 % , 20 % and 80 % for the SBS , RMS and RNS methods , respectively , with similar effects seen at 12 weeks and for the full epidemic ( electronic supplementary material , figure S17 ) . Similar behaviour is observed in Aberdeenshire ( electronic supplementary material , figure S19 ) . The values for S min for the full epidemic for all sampling methods for epidemics seeded in the three counties are summarized in electronic supplementary material , table S1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
