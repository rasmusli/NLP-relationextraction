The calibration curve of lycorine obtained with the developed HPLC method was linear over the range of concentration from 0 . 20 to 50 g / mL with a mean slope of 1493 , mean intercept value of 177 . 8 , and correlation coefficient of greater than 0 . 999 . The within - day and between - day precisions and accuracies for the analysis of lycorine are shown in Table 1 . The accuracy values , expressed as percentage of true value , were between 95 . 38 % and 104 . 75 % , while the corresponding precision values expressed as correlation of variation ( CV ) were between 0 . 73 % and 8 . 15 % for both within - day and between - day analysis , thus indicating that the present HPLC - UV method was reliable and repeatable .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
