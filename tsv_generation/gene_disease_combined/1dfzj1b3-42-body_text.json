The authors [ 43 ] using this method showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris , Eugenia caryophyllus , Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume . , Ocimum basilicum L . and Illicium verum Hook . f . were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system , after 40 days of storage . The decrease of hexanal was followed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector . Such results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation , since Illicium verum oil was mainly cosnstituted by anethole [ 43 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
