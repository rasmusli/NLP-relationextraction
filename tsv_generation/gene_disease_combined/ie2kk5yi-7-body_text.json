{"cord_uid": "ie2kk5yi", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6159870", "divid": "7", "text": "Given the zoonotic potential of bat - associated Bartonella , understanding transmission within bats is critical for understanding how Bartonella persists in bat populations and for assessing spillover risks [ 22 , 23 ] . Ectoparasites are frequently invoked as a transmission route [ 12 , 19 , 24 ] , in part because vector - borne transmission occurs in other taxa [ 25 , 26 ] and because Bartonella has been identified in bat flies and ticks [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] . While some bat ticks can feed on humans [ 30 ] , the high host specificity of bat flies [ 31 , 32 ] could limit opportunities for crossspecies transmission through ectoparasites [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] . Transmission through close contact ( e . g . , biting ) could occur given detection of Bartonella in dog and cat saliva [ 34 , 35 ] as well as human infection following scratches from dogs and cats [ 36 ] . Phylogenetic patterns of weak Bartonella host specificity in Neotropical bat communities could not only reflect transmission through close contacts between species in multi - species roosts , but could also stem from transmission through generalist vectors [ 15 , 24 , 37 ] . Bartonella might also be transmitted through exposure to feces between bats and to humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [ 18 , 38 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
