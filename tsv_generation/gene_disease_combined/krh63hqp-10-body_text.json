Even though the influenza genome is broken into eight separate RNAs , unless an individual is infected with two strains simultaneously ( providing an opportunity for reassortment ) , all eight sections are inherited as a set in a form of linkage [ 36 ] . Thus , neutral and slightly deleterious mutations are carried along with those mutations under positive or purifying selection . This gives us enough information to make many phylogenetic inferences , and we have a wealth of data telling us the history of the various viral lines , but these phylogenetic techniques ignore genetic change within a larger portion of the genome in order to focus on the phylogenetically - informative sites . There is abundant evidence for multiple substitutions in specific places that are , in turn , sites of active selection [ 42 ] , but what about the rest of the genome ? Fitch , et al . [ 36 ] noted that the main strategy of influenza viruses was to outrun the immune system of the host by maintaining a high mutation rate . They wondered \" why such a virus does not accumulate so many deleterious mutations as to die of its own ineptitude . \" They further wondered if the only reason influenza viruses continued to circulate in mammalian species was because of a sort of \" gene therapy \" through reassortment with stronger , less mutated avian viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 179}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1082}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1332, "end": 1342}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
