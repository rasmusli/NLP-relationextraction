This holds true within the GSCC for all node sampling schemes ( electronic supplementary material , figure S4 ) . Similar behaviour is observed for the mean local clustering coefficient , which is small and does not change appreciably . The network diameter is 24 - TNS and SBS preserve this relatively small diameter well within the GSCC , but for small sample sizes the diameter increases under the RNS scheme . Plots for assortativity , clustering and diameter are shown in electronic supplementary material , figure S4 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
