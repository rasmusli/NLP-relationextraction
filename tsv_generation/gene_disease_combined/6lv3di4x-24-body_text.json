For the present work , we employed the same JEV strains as in our previously published in vivo studies ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) : JEV Laos , belonging to genotype 1 ( CNS769 _ Laos _ 2009 ; GenBank accession number KC196115 . 1 [ 67 ] ; kindly provided by R . Charrel , Aix - Marseille Universit\u00e9 , France ) , and JEV Nakayama , genotype 3 ( National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses , Salisbury , UK ) . JEV was propagated in Vero cells ( ATCC CCL81 ) in G - MEM BHK - 21 medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Basel , Switzerland ) supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Biowest , Nuaill\u00e9 , France ) and cultured at 37 \u00b0 C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Viral titers were determined in Vero cells using the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay ( IPMA ) with the anti - flavivirus E antibody 4G2 ( ATCC HB - 112 ) . Titers were calculated and expressed as 50 % tissue culture infective dose ( TCID 50 ) per milliliter .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
