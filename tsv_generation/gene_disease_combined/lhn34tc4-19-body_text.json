Table 1 presents a summary of the demographic characteristics of this sample . The majority were middle - aged ( 56 % ) and female ( 64 % ) . Within this sample , 4 % of participants were personally impacted by quarantine during the SARS crisis ( i . e . , either they or someone else in their home was ordered into quarantine ) . Table 2 presents the distribution of responses for each of the 15 Likert - type survey items ( from \" Strongly Agree \" through to \" Strongly Disagree \" ) . In the table , the wording of the individual items is precisely as appeared on the survey instrument ; however , for the purposes of presentation , the items are clustered according to the findings of the factor analysis ( as described below ) . As there were no significant differences between respondents from Toronto versus York , the overall results are shown . The vast majority of respondents indicated agreement ( either \" Strongly Agree \" or \" Somewhat Agree \" ) that sufficient justification exists for the use of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks . Similarly , most respondents agreed that public health authorities and government officials should endeavour to lessen the burdens endured by those ordered into quarantine . Likewise , there was majority support for the use of various legal sanctions , penalties , and / or coercive measures in order to maximize compliance with quarantine orders . And , finally , the vast majority of respondents were in favour of safeguards against unwarranted and / or inappropriate use of quarantine . While these high percentages suggest a certain degree of convergence of opinion , it is important to note that the proportion of respondents indicating \" Strongly Agree \" versus \" Somewhat Agree \" varies significantly across the 15 items , as indicated in Table 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 322, "end": 334}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
