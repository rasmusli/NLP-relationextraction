However , the aims of the paper are not currently well stated ( in both the main text and in the abstract ) . The main statement of the aims comes towards the end of page 5 , which states \" This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements \" . This doesn ' t really capture what the authors have actually done . There is a slightly better statement of the aims hidden in the Methods ( top of page 7 ) but even this doesn ' t quite feel sufficient .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
