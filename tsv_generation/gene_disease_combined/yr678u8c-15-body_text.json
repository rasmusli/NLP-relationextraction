Furthermore , individual expression of IBV nsp6 , as well as nsp6 homologues from other viruses in the Nidovirales order , has been shown to induce autophagy [ 55 ] . However , the mechanism by which this induction occurs is unknown . Whether nsp6 is responsible for inducing autophagy in the context of whole virus would also be interesting to discover . In addition , as IBV is restricted to avian species , would similar observations be made in a more natural host model ? Finally , several studies have shown that coronavirus infection induces autophagy [ 9 , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 54 , 55 ] . However , the pathway does not appear to be required for virus replication [ 52 , 53 , 55 , 56 ] . Therefore , is autophagy acting as a cellular defence to virus infection and does the virus have mechanisms to control this response ?", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 138, "end": 143}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 172}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 343}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
