For the SARS - CoV , the infectivity of pathogens contained in the droplets of different size classes show no differences , hence the infectivity r l can be expressed as r . According to the experiments on mice for the development of vaccine , efficient replication of the virus is found in the respiratory tract of the mice after they are administered at a very low dose of the SARS - CoV [ 47 , 48 ] , indicating high infectivity of the SARS - CoV . Since no other infectivity data is found , the infectivity factor r is assumed as 1 per pfu of virus in this work because of the high infectivity of the SARS - CoV . In Eq . ( 2 ) , N c f s t 0 D ( x , t 0 ) can also be regarded as the intake dose of the passenger . To evaluate the effects of different human movement behaviors , the intake fractions of the seated passengers can be expressed as followed :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
