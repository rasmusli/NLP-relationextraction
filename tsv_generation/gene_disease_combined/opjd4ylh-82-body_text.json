They are the core members of the hospital who produce good and quality results . Therefore , it is important for the hospital CEO and nursing unit managers to support them in order for them to remain productive . The hospitals should make sure that they order quality equipment , and other materials to assist nurses to do their work effectively . Nurses should be provided with adequate and necessary training to empower them with relevant skills and knowledge . Good management empowers employees in the hospital in different ways and also listens to their requests . Below are the comments made by the participants : Nurse ( N5 ) said : \" Hmmm , we believe that for now we just need special support from the management and all TB programme managers , to empower us with knowledge maybe by having workshops with us or arranging in - service training . It is crucial that we gain more knowledge on how to communicate with patients who are showing side effects or who are likely to default when they are at home . I believe that if we can be empowered with knowledge , the death rate and the spread of disease can be reduced . \"", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 799}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
