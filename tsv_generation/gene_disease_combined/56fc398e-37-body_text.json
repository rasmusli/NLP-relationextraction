This method proved ineffective at reproducing the mean epidemics seen on the complete network . An alternative strategy to collect movement data would be to randomly sample movements from any farm ( i . e . the RMS method ) . In a practical sense , this would be a much more difficult strategy to implement , requiring individual farmers to keep a record of livestock moving from their farm a given percentage of the time . This method is found to be more effective than the RNS method , particularly in the case when within - market transmission occurs . In that case , only 10 - 20 % of movements are required in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes . For lower percentages , the model predicts smaller epidemics than observed using the true network data , and in that case suggested intervention strategies may not be sufficient to control outbreaks . It may , however , be possible to make accurate predictions with a lower percentage of movement data when incorporating a Bayesian kernel approach to scale up a partially observed network [ 43 ] . An alternative approach may be to adopt targeted movement sampling where movements would be recorded based on some criterion . For example , particularly frequent movements between pairs of nodes could be recorded , or shipments involving a large number of animals . Both these options were investigated , but neither proved to be particularly successful at reconstructing an accurate realization of the original network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
