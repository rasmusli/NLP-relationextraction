Government programs in Brazil that intend to provide free mosquito repellent to pregnant women do not consistently reach some of the poorest communities , such communities are remote and often lack accessible quality health care facilities due to distance and poor physical infrastructure ( Hennigan 2016 ) . Access to quality reproductive health care is essential given the accumulating evidence linking the Zika virus to a rise in cases of infants born with microcephaly - an unusually small head for age and sex ( World Health Organization 2017a ) . Conditions related to poverty , such as poor sanitation and increased exposure to larvicides and insecticides , which may cause mutation , have also been implicated ( Diniz 2016 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 134}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 628, "end": 639}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
