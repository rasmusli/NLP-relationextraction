{"cord_uid": "s1gwh4qg", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2739203", "divid": "12", "text": "There are two ways of defining format of the UID conversion : using either precompiled or user - defined name templates . The user is currently provided with several precompiled templates for name generation , which can be used \" as is \" or after refinement ( see below ) . Each template is accompanied with examples of input to illustrate its usage . \" Entry name \" template can be useful for identifying misspelled identifiers , as well as for comparative inspection of basic information about the entries in UniProt . Two other templates ( \" Gene \" and \" Species \" ) can be used for converting UIDs into gene and species names , respectively , as they are specified in GenBank . The \" Complex species name \" template combines full species name with primary ID ( gi ) that are neatly separated . The \" Complex protein name \" includes primary ID , condensed species name , protein description and CDS , and locus tag , in a size restricted manner to facilitate reading a complex name structure . These templates are suited for producing names of sequences originated from a wide range of organisms . \" Acronym \" template converts GenBank organism name annotation into acronym . Three templates were designed specifically for viruses to address specifics of this group for which the naming remains a matter of debate [ 15 , 17 ] . For several medically important viruses with large sampling from the natural diversity , e . g . influenza and noroviruses [ 18 , 22 ] , names conventions were accepted by the field to include reference to serotype , host species , country of isolation , strain or isolate name , collection date and , for influenza viruses , subtype . These names are part of the GenBank entries where from they can be readily extracted . To demonstrate that similar names can be also generated on - the - fly from two components , using the isolate / strain and serotype fields in respective entries , a separate \" Influenza virus name \" template is provided . We extended this approach by designing two other virus templates , \" Complex virus name I \" and \" Complex virus name II \" , that could generate names with complex structure for majority of other viruses for which no consensus on the naming has been reached . These templates combine information from up to six separate entry fields , each keeping an elementary record e . g . about date or place of virus isolation . \" Complex virus name II \" additionally includes reference to protein function . These templates could help researchers studying many viruses , e . g . coronaviruses and picornaviruses [ 15 ] communicate their sequence - based data in a name format similar to that accepted for influenza virus . SNAD - mediated solution to the generation of complex virus names reinforces the role of diverse fields in sequence entries as the primary source of information . If these fields are completed with records as expected , virus names can be readily generated under different and evolving conventions . Thus , SNAD provides a tool for explora - SNAD dataflow Figure 1 SNAD dataflow . User submits sequence UIDs and defines a format of conversion by choosing a template . SNAD analyzes the input , extracts UIDs from it and queries a user - defined database to locate cognate entries . The next step is extracting annotation from the entries and parsing the user - selected template to generate separate parts . They are mapped onto annotation to produce name parts , which are combined into names according to the template . Finally , SNAD substitutes the submitted UIDs in list , alignment , or tree with the designed names and returns results to the user . Unique IDs conversion with SNAD . Nine IDs from GenBank ( section \" Before UID conversion \" ) are converted using a pre - compiled four - characteristic template \" Complex protein name \" that includes the following GenBank characteristics : \" Primary ID \" ( gi number ) ; organism name formatted as \" G [ enus ] . species \" ; protein product and gene locus tag . Three delimiters are used : space , \" [ \" and \" ] \" , and none of characteristics is abbreviated . First three characteristics have their size limited to : 9 , 6 , and 17 symbols , respectively . Results of the conversion are shown in \" After UID conversion \" section . Each arrow links a delimiter to a part of converted names . { . . . } indicates that more than one organism name characteristic is found for a submitted ID ( see [ GenBank / Protein : 126224 ] , features source / organism ) . SNAD users can initiate refining of any of the provided templates ( by using \" Refine name template \" option ) or generate de novo templates by choosing \" User defined \" template that automatically activates the refining mode . In both instances , the advanced template - building facility becomes available for the user . It empowers the user with fine control over the output name format , including the number of independently designed parts of the name , characteristic of each part , parts order , size of each part , and type of delimiter preceding each part ( Figure 2 ) . Design of each part in the name is controlled by a separate row . The name parts - from left to right - are defined by respective rows in the template - building facility from top to bottom . Rows can be moved up and down or deleted and inserted with a respective effect on the name structure and content . For retrieving sequence characteristics from database entries SNAD uses BioPerl scheme with internally controlled vocabulary of annotation [ 26 ] . Information from two or more annotation fields can also be combined in a single characteristic in a template . For instance , for virus name templates , a combination \" strain OR isolate \" may be used to form a characteristic . For name designing , the user can choose from a dropdown menu of sequence characteristics and features that were derived from available databases . These characteristics can be used separately or in combination to design a name format that can combine , for instance , unique reference to the original database with a concise biological description of the entry ( see Figure 2 for an example ) . For characteristics which values are described with several words , first letters of these words can be combined using characteristic ' s \" abbreviate \" option to produce acronyms . If a selected characteristic is not available in annotation for a sequence , it is replaced in the sequence name with a symbol that the user selected from a separate drop - down menu . Due to gaps in annotation , names designed with the templates may not be complete for every entry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 709}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 734, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 752, "end": 763}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 825}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 847}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 849, "end": 872}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 898, "end": 902}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 918}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 995}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1103, "end": 1111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1931, "end": 1963}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 2046, "end": 2067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 2075, "end": 2097}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 2396, "end": 2418}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
