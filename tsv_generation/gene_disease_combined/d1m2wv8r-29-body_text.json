KR611475 . 1 ) was passaged ten times in F81 cells , resulting in a final stock containing viruses at 10 5 . 5 TCID 50 / mL . For infection , 10 6 F81 cells were plated in 25 cm 2 culture flasks and , at the same time , inoculated by CPV at a MOI of 1 . Infected cells were collected at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 hpi , and uninfected mock - treated cells were collected at 0 and 48 h after plating . All experiments were repeated in three biological replicates with cells at different passage numbers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
