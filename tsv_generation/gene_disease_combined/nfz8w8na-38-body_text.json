The socioeconomic distribution of Ebola was political , as defined for the purposes of this review , in that many scholars attribute its emergence to the socioeconomic conditions of Liberia . For example , poverty , and subsequent limited investment into the health system led to weak public health infrastructure , insufficient information technologies , a lack of trained personnel , inadequate case reporting , was often cited as the key vulnerability of Liberia ( Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; McNamara 2016 ; Maras and Miranda 2016 ; Scott et al . 2016 ) . Additional challenges included mobility of particular populations , authority distrust , economic instability , and a lack of governance ( McNamara 2016 ) . These challenges intersected with other stressors , such as climate change and food insecurity to intensify the effects of the Ebola epidemic ( Scott et al . 2016 ) . Many rural communities in Liberia were particularly vulnerable , extremely poor , and lacking secure access to food and health clinics ( Scott et al . 2016 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 24}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 177}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 930, "end": 946}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 984}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
