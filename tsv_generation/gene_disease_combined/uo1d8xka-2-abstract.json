In particular , it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes . Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor , analyze , and possibly predict the evolution of viruses . However , in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for largescale phyloinformatics studies , a team of computer scientists , biostatisticians and virologists is needed - a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases . Furthermore , the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms . This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
