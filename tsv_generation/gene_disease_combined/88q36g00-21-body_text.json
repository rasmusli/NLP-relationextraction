The experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nagoya University ( approval number : 29154 ) , and were carried out in accordance with the Regulations on Animal Experiments in Nagoya University . Pregnant ICR ( CD - 1 ) mice ( 7 - 8 weeks ) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories ( Kanagawa , Japan ) . All mice were allowed free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12 - h light / dark cycle ( lights on at 9 : 00 AM ) . The pregnant mice were assigned randomly to three groups of five dams each : Control group , LPS group , and HW + LPS group ( Fig . 6 ) , as in our previous report 12 . All pregnant mice , except for those in the Control group , received an intraperitoneal injection ( i . p . ) of 75 \u03bcg of LPS dissolved in sterile saline on E17 . In the Control group , the pregnant mice were injected with an equal volume of sterile saline . In the HW + LPS group , the pregnant mice were administered HW , beginning 24 h before LPS injection and continuing until parturition . HW was aliquoted in glass drinking bottles to prevent H 2 degassing as well as air refilling . Offspring growth evaluation and behavioral testing . As shown in Fig . 6 , after birth , all offspring were housed with their mother until P19 , when they were weaned , as previously reported 76 , 77 . We only used male offspring in all of the experiments because of previously reported sex effects 43 . All animals were left undisturbed except for measuring body weights and weekly cage changes . Body weight was recorded at P4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 13 , 16 , and 19 . The order of the behavioral tests was as follows : ( 1 ) Y - maze test at postnatal 3 weeks 78 ; and ( 2 ) three - chamber sociability and social novelty test 79 and PPI test at postnatal 4 weeks , according to previous reports ( Fig . 6 ) . All behavioral tests were conducted between 1 PM and 8 PM .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
