Subsequent refinements of the model have incorporated an additional exposed ( infected but not yet infectious ) class ( susceptible - exposed - infectious - recovered [ SEIR ] models ) ( see Protocol S1 for mathematical equations ) . One of the fundamental mathematical assumptions in such models is that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious class is constant , irrespective of the period already spent in that class . While mathematically very convenient , this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods , which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . A more sensible formulation would be to specify the probability of leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class , such that initially the chance of leaving the class is small , but the probability increases as the mean infectious / latent period is reached . This would give rise to a more realistic distribution of latent and infectious periods , with a stronger central tendency . A convenient way to describe such distributions is to write an expression for the infectious class ( neglecting the latent class for this example ) as follows :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
