For example , Satureja intricata Lange had ability for scavenging both DPPH and ABTS , whereas Satureja obovata Lag . did not possess such ability [ 77 ] . This behaviour could be attributed to the presence of thymol and its precursors p - cymene and \u03b3 - terpinene , along with borneol in Satureja intricata . The essential oils of Artemisia herba - alba already reported above as possessing little ability for inhibiting lipid peroxidation [ 45 ] , when evaluated in terms of free radical scavenging , the oils continued to have weak activity . In this case and in contrast to other works [ 44 , 51 ] , the essential oil of Artemisia herba - alba was not effective either against lipid oxidation nor as a free radical scavenger .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
