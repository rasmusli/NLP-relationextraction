They raised the more technical but nonetheless very important question of how the type of CPP and the way it is linked to the PNA affects the ability of the PNA to reach its cellular target . They conjugated the PNA to the CPP either via a stable polyether linker or through a cleavable disulfide bond and tested a range of CPPs . They could inhibit tat - dependent trans - activation in HeLa cells with disulfide - linked conjugates of PNA to transportan or to the chimeric peptide R 6 - penetratin ( R = L - arginine ) . However , unlike what was reported by Tripathi et a l . [ 93 ] , they found that tat and penetratin conjugates failed to inhibit transcription . None of the conjugates carrying the stable polyether linker could elicit trans - activation inhibition . Interestingly , supplementation of cell medium with the lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine enhanced inhibitory activity of disulfide - linked conjugates and stablylinked conjugates gained some inhibitory activity . Supported by confocal microscopy data on cell localization of conjugates , the authors argued that endosomal release is a limiting factor in conjugates efficiency : following cell uptake , CPP - PNA conjugates would be entrapped in endosomal or other membrane - bound cytosolic compartments and some of them would then be slowly released . Endosomal entrapment was also reported with PPMO conjugates [ 79 ] . However , this observation differs from Chaubey et al . conclusion of the conjugates not being taken up by the endocytic pathway as uptake was not affected by low temperature or phenylarsine oxide [ 92 ] . Turner et al . attempted to improve not only the cell delivery but also the endosomal release properties of CPPs to increase PNA antiviral activity [ 95 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 90}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 465}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 490}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 573, "end": 577}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 748, "end": 759}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1313, "end": 1317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1847, "end": 1852}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1864, "end": 1868}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
