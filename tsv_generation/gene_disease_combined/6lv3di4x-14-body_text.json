The second observation was that JEV harvested from NEC had enhanced infectivity for IL - 4 - treated macrophages ( Fig . 7A ) and resulted in higher levels of replication in all macrophage cultures than obtained with virus grown in Vero cells ( Fig . 7B ) . This indicated the presence of additional factors released by epithelial cells with a potential to enhance infection of macrophages .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
