We collected samples from 18 children with KD and 69 febrile controls presenting to the emergency department . Overall , we saw an increase in IGG + B cells , but not a cumulative increase in B cells [ 149 ] . Notably , we did not observe an increase in circulating IgA + B cells . The result of this study is consistent with the majority of the literature that shows B cell stimulation and increasing peripheral B cell numbers during KD [ 4 , 5 , 99 , 100 ] . Both KD and infectious control children showed comparable elevations of PBs compared to controls [ 149 ] . Importantly , the levels did not correlate with CRPs and were not excessive , which are characteristics of PB responses in autoimmunity . Unfortunately , only five children had repeat samples . Of these five , all had PB elevations on one or both timepoints , leaving only 3 of 18 KD samples not having a measurable elevation of their PBs in this study generally limited to one timepoint . We are currently collecting samples over multiple timepoints to more thoroughly explore this phenomenon .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 25}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 169}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 558, "end": 561}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 592}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 814, "end": 827}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 975}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
