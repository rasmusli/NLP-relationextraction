Since we ruled out other microbiological agents as causes of salpingitis , the clinical picture associated with the replication of this virus in healthy chicken layers , allow us to think of it as an atypical pathotype of LPAI virus , capable of causing permanent economic losses , regardless of concomitant diseases in the flock . Under this perspective , we think this virus should be considered a primary pathogen of the oviduct , similarly to IBV , NDV and HPAI viruses [ 43 , 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 365}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 519}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 758}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
