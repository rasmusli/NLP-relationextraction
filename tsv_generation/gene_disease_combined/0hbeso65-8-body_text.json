HCV virus binds to the new allograft at the time of reperfusion , and viral replication occurs within hours after LT . The impact of recipients ' viral load on HCV recurrence following LT is still uncertain , but a clear understanding of HCV kinetics after LT will contribute to the development of strategies to prevent HCV infection of the allograft . An earlier study , which analyzed HCV kinetics during and immediately after LT , found a sharp decrease in HCV viral load during the anhepatic phase and immediately after graft reperfusion [ 3 ] . This decrease was presumably attributed to massive binding of HCV to the hepatocytes . In other words , reinfection is immediate after reperfusion . Powers et al . also reported that HCV RNA levels dropped with an average half - life of 0 . 8 hours during the anhepatic phase [ 14 ] . The authors also mentioned that viral loads then continued to drop up to 23 hours after implantation , and began to rise as soon as 15 hours after the anhepatic phase . Moreover , the viral load reached a plateau before rising , suggesting that a nonhepatic source supplied virions and balanced their intrinsic clearance . It was estimated that nonhepatic sources were at most responsible for 4 % of total viral production and the remaining 96 % occurred in the liver .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 828}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 7, "end": 11}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 421}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
