For each epidemic , the search terms included the name of the disease outbreak and the country of interest : BSARS AND Toronto , ^ BZika AND Brazil , ^ and BEbola AND Liberia . ^ It was vital that each search included the income setting to ensure that the findings were contextually relevant . These terms were then combined with the terms Bsociet * , ^ Bsociol * , ^ and Bpolitic * . ^ Truncation was used to ensure inclusion of all terms , including Bsociety , ^ Bsocietal , B sociological , ^ Bsociology , ^ Bpolitics , ^ Bpolitical , B politician , ^ and Bpoliticization . ^ The search terms must have Tables 2 , 3 , and 4 summarize the search results for the three outbreaks within the specified contexts . The titles and abstracts of the search results were reviewed for relevance to the politics of epidemics . All biomedical articles describing biomedical research were excluded . All articles that were relevant to the study topic were retrieved and reviewed . The initial review involved RA , grouping the search results according to the disease outbreak . For each outbreak , RA first scanned through a couple of papers , identifying the emerging themes . Once these were identified , subsequent reviews were structured along these themes , although an open stance was maintained throughout to enable the reviewer to identify any additional relevant themes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1157}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
