By using likelihood analysis , the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rate values , a 1 and a 2 can be obtained ( data not shown ) . The result shows that the maximum likelihood is still 0 . 414 when the quanta generation rate is 0 . 141 million and both of a 1 and a 2 are zero . So the no movement assumption best represents the outbreak case . This result fits with the findings of a previous study , which analyzed a multi - drug resistant tuberculosis outbreak case in an airplane cabin by using likelihood analysis [ 18 ] . Yin et al . [ 18 ] did not simulate human movement but using a ' mixing ratio ' concept to analyze the effect of human movement on the transmission of infectious disease . It was also found in the tuberculosis case that the likelihood reached maximum at mixing ratio close to zero , which indicated that human movement only had insignificant effect on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 667, "end": 703}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 927, "end": 946}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 986}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1157, "end": 1189}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
