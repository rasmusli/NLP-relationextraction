Suppose that { Y k , t } is the process defined as the sum of { O k , t } , the extra radiograph counts attributable to the outbreak , and the radiograph process { R k , t } that follows model ( 1 ) . Removing the non - stationary part due to the estimated effect of the covariates yields By applying the filter to this series we obtain the detection process that we would observe in the presence of extra counts attributable to an outbreak :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
