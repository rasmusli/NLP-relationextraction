These studies can be performed while simulating any of 525 distinct media conditions currently encoded in the SEED database ( which includes all BiologH [ 30 ] media conditions and a variety of complex media formulations ) . Both the Perl program and the API enable users to obtain a list of the media conditions currently stored in the SEED and details on the compounds included in each formulation . Once a model and media condition have been selected for simulation , the server provides an interface for running three types of FBA simulation : ( i ) simple growth simulation to predict maximum growth rate of the organism in the selected media , ( ii ) flux variability analysis ( FVA ) [ 31 ] to classify the reactions and compounds in the model according to their behavior during growth in the selected media , and ( iii ) single gene knockout analysis to predict the genes essential for growth in the selected media .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
