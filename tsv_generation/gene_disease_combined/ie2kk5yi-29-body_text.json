Although BLAST also identified Bartonella spp . sequenced from rodents , carnivores , and livestock within our hit selection criteria , these consistently formed separate phylogenetic clades that did not contain bat - or bat fly - derived Bartonella ( Fig 3 ) . These phylogenetic patterns indicate that Bartonella has commonly shifted between bat host species in the Americas but do not support frequent transmission between bats and other host groups . Our BaTS analysis also showed that vampire bat Bartonella sequences clustered by country more than expected by chance . However , given that several Bartonella genotypes were present in vampire bats from both Central and South America , we suspect this clustering mostly resulted from variation in locally abundant genotypes rather than true barriers to the spread of Bartonella . Because vampire bats are largely sedentary and non - migratory [ 45 ] , dispersal of these Bartonella genotypes across large distances is unlikely to be attributable to bat movement alone . Bartonella genotypes may also have infected vampire bats over long evolutionary timescales , and thus the biogeography of the pathogen may have followed that of its host . Alternatively , Bartonella dispersal by other arthropod vectors ( e . g . , ticks ) or other bat species that share Bartonella genotypes with vampire bats may be conceivable and could be resolved by further field surveys combined with population genetic analyses of alternative bat host species , arthropod vector species , and Bartonella genotypes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 1004}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
