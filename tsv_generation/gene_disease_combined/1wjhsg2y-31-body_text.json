Based on our current understanding of CoV systematics , all human CoVs have evolutionary origins in wildlife reservoirs , with SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV , and human - CoVs NL63 and 229E considered to have originated in bats [ 39 , 124 , 125 ] . Moreover , spillover of bat - associated CoVs has occurred into domestic animals , for example SADS - CoV has a 90 % mortality rate in young piglets [ 33 , 124 ] . On a global scale , reported CoV diversity mirrored species richness , suggesting regions with greater species richness will also have higher CoV diversity [ 9 ] . We found that research effort on bat - associated CoVs was significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis ( r = 0 . 26 , p = 0 . 001 ) ( Table S3 ) . However , research effort was greatly skewed towards the United States and China ( Figure 6 ) , with 71 % of all other countries reporting no published research on bat - associated CoVs ( Table S4 ) . Not surprising , China published the most studies on bat - associated CoVs , which is largely driven by targeted efforts to Figure 5 . Research effort on bat - associated viruses by country . The research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms ( \" bat \" OR \" bats \" OR \" Chiroptera \" ) AND ( \" virus \" OR \" viruses \" ) by country .
