For most outcomes this interaction was not significant , with the individual level diary score as an exception . When looking at sports activity , for most outcomes the association with obesity was confined to those physically more active and not seen for those reporting little sports activity ( Table 5 ) . For all outcomes the association was less pronounced in the latter group ( compare the ratios of ORs in Table 5 ) , a difference that reached significance for all outcomes except those with low prevalence . Typically the prevalence of an outcome was only increased in the small group of people with obesity and higher sports activity whereas all other groups presented rather similar patterns . Similarly , the prevalence of outcomes was increased among people with obesity and a more favourable nutritional pattern , but comparable among the other groups ( Table 6 ) . The interaction reaches significance for the majority of outcomes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 32}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 356}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 770, "end": 778}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 945}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
