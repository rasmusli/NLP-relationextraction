Because air travel is a consistent and highly supported explanatory variable for global influenza dispersal , communities within the air transportation network are likely to provide the most appropriate spatial structuring of our data . However , in addition to the partitioning itself , further research is also needed to select the appropriate number of samples from the resulting regions to improve on ad hoc down - sampling based on population size .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
