Statistical analyses were performed using Stata / MP 10 . 0 for Macintosh ( Stata Corporation , College Station , TX , USA ) . The 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for proportions were calculated with binominal exact confidence interval using the ' ci ' command . Of the children included in this analysis , 274 were enrolled twice and 18 thrice . We used the ' cluster ' option in Stata to adjust the confidence intervals of the proportions for repeated enrollments and thus allowed for possible dependence of observations in a child that was included more than once . Anthropometric measures were expressed as Z - scores , which were generated using the WHO Child Growth Standards 2005 [ 23 ] . Meteorological data for the Kathmandu airport weather station ( located approximately 10 km from Bhaktapur ) were obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology , Ministry of Environment , Science and Technology , Kathmandu , Nepal . Mean daily values for relative humidity and temperature were calculated as the average of two daily measurements ( relative humidity at 8 . 45 AM and 5 . 45 PM , and maximum and minimum temperature ) . We estimated the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient to describe the association between the monthly number of infections with each virus and meteorological factors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
