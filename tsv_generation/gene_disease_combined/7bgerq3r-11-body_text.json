However , Oboho et al . [ 14 ] reported that 78 . 79 % ( 26 of 33 ) of initially reported asymptomatic patients had at least 1 symptom . In Korea , among the 186 confirmed cases , 3 asymptomatic cases were detected among healthcare workers via screening tests ( 1 . 61 % ) [ 15 ] . In serologic studies using indirect immunofluorescence tests for healthcare workers who were at MERS - affected hospitals , 2 of 457 ( 0 . 44 % ) had positive results [ 16 ] . However , no report has been published regarding the asymptomatic infection rate among non - healthcare workers in Korea . There is a considerable chance of human - to - human transmission , as well as direct infection via the dromedary camel [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . Therefore , it is necessary to identify the rate of asymptomatic MERS infections in healthcare workers and non - healthcare workers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 697}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1103, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
