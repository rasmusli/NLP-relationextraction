The body length of female C . nigribarbis is 11 - 15 mm and approximately 1 . 5 times larger than that of female A . grahami ( 8 - 13 mm ) . The capacity of the crop of female C . nigribarbis ( average = 23 mL ) is approximately five times greater than that of female A . grahami ( average = 4 . 4 mL ) [ 11 ] . The consumption rate of both C . nigribarbis and A . grahami might have been high because of their large body size . In fact , virus genes were found more often in C . nigribarbis than in A . grahami [ 11 ] . Stable flies , Muscina stabulans ( Falle ' n ) and M . angustifrons ( Loew ) , collected at the same collection sites and the same time as the fly surveillance in Kyoto , showed much smaller body size than C . nigribarbis and A . grahami , and no virus was detected in these smaller - sized flies [ 11 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
