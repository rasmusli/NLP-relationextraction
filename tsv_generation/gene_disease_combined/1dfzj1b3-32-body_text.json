The results were even better than those found for the reference BHA . The authors have also tested methanolic extracts of the same plants but the activities were about 100 times lower than those of the essential oils . The authors also hypothesise that the antiaflatoxigenic activity found for the essential oils may be partly due to their antioxidant activity [ 51 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
