Virus isolates from infected chickens were all identified as influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype [ 5 ] . Such highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) epidemics had not been reported in Japan for 79 years . Two avian influenza outbreaks at poultry farms in Tamba Town , Kyoto Prefecture , were the last two outbreaks of the 2004 avian epidemics in Japan . Since then , there were outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Okayama and Miyazaki Prefectures in 2007 . The H5N1 virus was also isolated from dead Whooper swans , Cygnus cygnus , in 2008 in Towada Lake , Akita Prefecture [ 6 ] . In addition , outbreaks of other subtypes of avian influenza virus have frequently occurred in Japan . The H5N2 avian influenza was reported in Ibaraki and Saitama Prefectures in 2005 and 2006 , the H3 subtype was reported in Saitama Prefecture in 2009 , and the H7 subtype was in Aichi Prefecture in 2009 . We know of no report suggesting that H5N1 virus could be transmitted efficaciously from person to person , but the possibility remains that such transmission could evolve [ 7 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 372}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 379}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 457}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 644}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 943}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
