The mixtures were added to the confluent layers of Vero cells and left at 37 \u00b0 C for adsorption for 2 h . A 2 \u00d7 DMEM media : soft - agar ( 1 : 1 ) overlay was added over cells and the plate was incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0 C . The agar overlay was removed and the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS , stained with crystal violet solution , washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS and the plates were left to dry . The plaques in assays done in 24 - well plates were scanned with an automated Immunospot reader ( CTL Limited ) , and the plaques in sample wells and in negative control ( DMEM only ) and positive control ( 100 PFU MR766 ZIKV virus only ) wells were counted using the automated software provided with the ELISpot reader . The percentage plaque reduction was calculated as follows : % reduction = 100 \u00d7 { 1 \u2212 ( average number of plaques for each dilution / average number of plaques in positive control wells ) } . GraphPad Prism software was used to perform nonlinear regression analysis of % plaque reduction versus a log transformation of each individual serum dilution to facilitate linear interpolation of actual 50 % PRNT titres at peak post vaccination response . The medians and interquartile ranges at 50 % neutralisation were calculated for each neutralisation target overall and by vaccine treatment group ; the geometric mean titres were also calculated . The titres represent the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in a 50 % reduction in the number of plaques .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 9}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1406, "end": 1411}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
