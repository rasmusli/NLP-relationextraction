Additional numbers may have been required to demonstrate a significant difference in Diet B and between the two dietary interventions . This study also relied on a comparison to baseline versus a comparison to a non - therapeutic control formula . A non - therapeutic control would have been ideal for establishing effectiveness of the therapeutic diets ; however , due to ethical considerations , all study participants were provided with a therapeutic dietary intervention . Additionally , this study relied on the owner ' s recall to establish the baseline weekly vomiting frequency . A recorded baseline would have been preferred ; however , it was decided that it was not in the cats ' best interest to delay dietary intervention . Finally , the lack of significance may have been influenced by the variability of clinical disease within individual cats . It was appreciated in this study that while most cats had a progressive decline of vomiting occurrences , some cats had episodic occurrences of vomiting that varied from week to week ( Figure 1 ) . The 4 - week feeding period was chosen to approximate a reasonable duration for a dietary trial with a gastrointestinal therapeutic formula before additional diagnostic procedures and / or medical treatments would be employed to better characterize and manage the underlying disease . While this study did not follow the cats beyond the 4 - week period , it would have been optimal to evaluate this cohort for 4 - 6 months to identify whether there were recrudescence of clinical signs and any differences between the two diet groups long term .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1167, "end": 1176}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
