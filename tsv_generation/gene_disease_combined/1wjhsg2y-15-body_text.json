To delimit \" Western Asia \" for the purposes of this review , we include the following 20 countries : Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Georgia , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , Iraq , Iran , Israel , Oman , Pakistan , Palestine , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , and Yemen . While Afghanistan and Pakistan are often considered part of \" Central \" or \" South \" Asia , we include both in this review as they serve as an important biogeographic gateway linking bats and ( potentially ) their associated pathogens with Asian countries to the east .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
