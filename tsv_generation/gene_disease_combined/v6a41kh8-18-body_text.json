An OD 450 < 0 . 300 with an OD 450 of the internal control > 2 . 00 indicated a negative test . A reading from 0 . 300 to 0 . 399 was interpreted as indeterminate and the sample examined again . If the same result was obtained on repeated testing , the NPA was deemed negative . If the OD 450 of the internal control for a given NPA was < 2 . 00 and sample absorbance was < 0 . 400 for all tested agents , the NPA was tested again . If the same result was obtained on repeated testing , the interpretation was indeterminate due to potential inhibition , and the case not included in the analyses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
