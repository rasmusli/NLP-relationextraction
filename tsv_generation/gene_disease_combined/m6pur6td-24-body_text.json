However , there are accounting discrepancies between the different types of methods [ 21 ] . Based on China ' s energy statistic and the reference approach of IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse gas Emission Inventories , there are mainly three approach to account , i . e . primary energy consumption ( e . g . coal , oil , natural gas , and renewables ) [ 63 ] , final energy consumption ( e . g . coal , oil , natural gas , renewables , and electricity / heating ) [ 61 , 62 ] , and total energy consumption from the \" Energy Balance Table \" including the aggregate summary of energy production , energy transformation and final consumption [ 76 , 77 ] . Compared with the primary energy consumption accounting and the final energy consumption accounting , apparent energy consumption data [ 78 , 79 ] from the comprehensive energy balance table was recommended for this study . As shown in the Table 3 , the comprehensive energy balance table is mainly based on three modules , namely , 1 ) total energy available for local consumption as a result of interprovincial and international energy trades , 2 ) input - output of energy conversion transformation for thermal power , heating , coking , petroleum refining , and gas production , 3 ) final consumption due to primary industry , secondary industry , tertiary industry , and residential consumption . Primary industry , namely , agriculture , mainly includes farming , forestry , animal husbandry , and fishery . Secondary industry includes manufacturing industries and construction industry . Tertiary industry includes transportation , storage , post and telecommunication services , wholesale , retail trade and catering services , and other service sectors . Then , we calculated energy - related carbon emissions by energy types according to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table , as follows the equation :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
