In general , antibiotics are administered orally for 10 days ( daily dose : 50 - 75 mg / kg for amoxicillin or amoxicillinclavulanate ) . 7 Of 16 ( 43 , 8 % ) patients responded well to treatment , in 3 of 16 ( 18 , 8 % ) no change in symptoms was noted , and data were missing for 6 patients . In 4 of 7 ( 57 , 1 % ) responders however , symptoms relapsed within 2 - 3 weeks after completion of the antibiotic treatment .
