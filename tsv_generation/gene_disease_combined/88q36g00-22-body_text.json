Briefly , the test was performed in a Y - shaped maze with three opaque plastic arms situated at 120 \u00b0 angles from each other . Each mouse was placed individually in the center of the apparatus and allowed to explore the maze freely during an 8 - min session . The series of arm entries were recorded visually . Alternation was defined as successive entries into the three arms , on overlapping triplet sets . The percent alternation was calculated as the ratio of actual to possible alternations ( defined as the total number of arm entries minus two ) multiplied by 100 . Spontaneous alternation ( % ) was used to quantify short - term memory .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
