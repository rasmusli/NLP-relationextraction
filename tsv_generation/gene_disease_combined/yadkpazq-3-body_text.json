In order to adapt to the solitary way of life of ancestral felids , these pathogens have acquired elaborate means to persist within their host population over the course of time . The infection of new hosts upon the rare contact between individuals was evolutionarily assured by very efficient transmission strategies and the induction of latent , chronic and / or asymptomatic infections . Often kept in multi - cat households and placed in catteries or shelters , today ' s domestic cat is consequently particularly susceptible to viral infections [ 1 , 2 ] . The close proximity and high social contact rate of animals with different vaccination states in these stressful environments further increases the risk of infection . Moreover , the strong antigenic variability of several common feline viruses including the feline calicivirus ( FCV ) , the feline coronavirus ( FCoV ) and the feline leukemia virus ( FeLV ) support escape from immune responses and lower the efficacy of currently available vaccines [ 3 ] . The availability of complementary prophylactic strategies could help protect pet cats in environments with high infectious pressure from long diseases and / or death caused by infections with fatal viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 611}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 967}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
