Using the growing lit - erature on the subject , we outline a stochastic model for an anthrax outbreak along with a healthcare utilization model for simulating people entering the ED . We then describe the methodology and theory for detecting unexpected outbreak signatures in time series sources using filters . We examine the form and function of the filters used for detection . In the results section , we explore the time series models obtained for each Midwest ED included in our study . We assess these detection methods using a simulated anthrax attack , and we end with a discussion .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 245}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 697, "end": 705}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
