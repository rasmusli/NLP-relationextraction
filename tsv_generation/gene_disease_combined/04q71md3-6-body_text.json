Several studies have demonstrated their utility and power , for example by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [ 13 ] and the spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [ 3 , 14 ] . More generally , it is recognized that the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza should be analysed in a framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics [ 15 ] . Current attempts to reconstruct viral spread through time and space from genetic data , however , typically fit parameter - rich models to sparse spatial data and result in phylogeographic patterns that are difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological processes [ 16 ] . Together with potential sampling bias , this complicates phylogeographic tasks , such as the characterization of source - sink dynamics in seasonal influenza . It is therefore unsurprising that different studies on the global circulation of H3N2 are sometimes inconsistent [ 3 , 14 , 17 ] , despite the importance of such work for influenza surveillance and vaccine strain selection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1019}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
