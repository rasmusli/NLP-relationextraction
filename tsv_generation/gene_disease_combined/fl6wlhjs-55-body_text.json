We assume that the resulting series { X k , t } , after accounting for these covariates , is stationary . We also ignore the fact that an individual may have multiple ED visits . Furthermore , these data do not contain any known anthrax outbreaks . Instead , outbreak patterns are simulated using a simple stochastic model . Although more care needs to be taken when summarizing simulation results , we agree with Buckeridge , et al . [ 16 ] and Brookmeyer , et al . [ 17 ] that stochastic outbreaks are more realistic than deterministic ones . Other results ( not presented here ) indicate that the results are different ( and possibly misleading ) with a smooth deterministic outbreak rather than a stochastic one . We utilize the four filters used by Reis , et al . [ 2 ] . Although filter design is an active area of research , especially in engineering , we decided to only study these four simple and fairly easy to understand filters . In the future we could extend our analysis to different choices of filter . We view wavelet - based biosurveillance methods [ 1 , 8 ] as extensions of this idea to different linear time - invariant filters . An important issue in filter - based - prediction methods is the choice of covariates and the correlation structure for the time series model . Clearly , the properties of the time series model could change with time . One way to improve the prediction of outbreak signatures is to use time - varying models , with parameters that slowly evolve over time . The use of time - varying parameter models is analogous to a periodic review of the parameter values . Window - based estimation methods could be used to re - estimate the model parameters . In this case , the choice of window length is critical as it represents a compromise between the efficiency to estimate the model parameters , and the sensitivity and specificity of detection . Other issues to be taken into account include negative singularities ( as defined by [ 8 ] ) that can cause a drop in the sensitivity . Abnormal points ( like holidays or severe weather ) can cause \" false alarms \" . Our solution to this problem is to jointly model chest radiograph and visit counts . So far , we have assumed that the visit counts are observed without error . Related to these issues , we are investigating methods that can be used to incorporate the uncertainty in parameter estimation upon the detection procedure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1157, "end": 1171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
