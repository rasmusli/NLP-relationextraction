Similarly , Zhang et al . 10 presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID - 19 . The results showed that among severe patients ( n = 58 ) , 3 . 4 % were current smokers and 6 . 9 % were former smokers , in contrast to non - severe patients ( n = 82 ) among which 0 % were current smokers and 3 . 7 % were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2 . 23 ; ( 95 % CI : 0 . 65 - 7 . 63 ; p = 0 . 2 ) . Huang et al . 11 studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID - 19 among 41 patients . In this study , none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU ( n = 13 ) was a current smoker . In contrast , three patients from the non - ICU group were current smokers , with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients ( p = 0 . 31 ) , albeit the small sample size of the study . The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID - 19 was provided by Guan et al . 12 from multiple regions of mainland China . Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients , of which 173 had severe symptoms , and 926 had non - severe symptoms . Among the patients with severe symptoms , 16 . 9 % were current smokers and 5 . 2 % were former smokers , in contrast to patients with non - severe symptoms where 11 . 8 % were current smokers and 1 . 3 % were former smokers . Additionally , in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation , admission to an ICU or died , 25 . 5 % were current smokers and 7 . 6 % were former smokers . In contrast , in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes , only 11 . 8 % were current smokers and 1 . 6 % were former smokers . No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study . Finally , Liu et al . 13 found among their population of 78 patients with COVID - 19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking ( 27 . 3 % ) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization ( 3 . 0 % ) , with this difference statistically significant at the p = 0 . 018 level . In their multivariate logistic regression analysis , the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression ( OR = 14 . 28 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 58 - 25 . 00 ; p = 0 . 018 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 72}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 170}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 561}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 961}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1976, "end": 1987}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
