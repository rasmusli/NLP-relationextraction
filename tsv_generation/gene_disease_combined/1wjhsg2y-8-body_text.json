For example , hunting of bats for bushmeat , a major threat to Old World fruit bats [ 56 , 64 ] , is a high risk activity that puts hunters and butchers in direct contact with blood and excreta and increases the risk of viral spillover from bats [ 65 , 66 ] . Direct persecution of bats and attempts at population eradication ( e . g . , the recent culling of bats in Mauritius [ 67 , 68 ] ) may have countereffects by actually increasing viral prevalence in the bat population [ 69 ] , and also increasing the opportunities for viral spillover through direct contact with bats during culling [ 12 , 69 , 70 ] . Similarly , the loss of bat habitat through land conversion for agricultural and livestock production and development , the primary threat to bats globally [ 3 , 71 ] , is a major risk factor for zoonotic disease emergence [ 22 ] . Clearing of forested habitats , specifically for agricultural crops ( e . g . , fruit orchards ) , leads to the direct destruction of roosting and foraging sites , and therefore displaces bat populations . It also creates a direct interface between frugivorous bats and humans or livestock that can mediate viral species jumps ( e . g . , Old World fruit bats and Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh ) [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] . Cave disturbance , such as resource extraction ( guano or mineral mining ) , hunting , and ecotourism , is a major threat to bat populations [ 75 ] , especially for species less tolerant to human disturbance [ 76 ] , but can also lead to increased contact between bats and humans that may facilitate viral spillover . For example , 7 of 13 cases of Marburg virus spillover to humans have been linked to gold mining activities , and other isolated cases have been linked to ecotourism in caves occupied by Rousettus aegyptiacus [ 77 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 233}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1070}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1453, "end": 1465}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1866, "end": 1880}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
