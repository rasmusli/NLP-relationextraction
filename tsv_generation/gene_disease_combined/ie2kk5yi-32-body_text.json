{"cord_uid": "ie2kk5yi", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6159870", "divid": "32", "text": "Although vector - borne transmission is generally assumed for Bartonella in other hosts [ 12 , 19 , 25 , 77 ] , including some Neotropical bats [ 16 , 78 ] , infection status in vampire bats was not associated with bat fly intensity . Further supporting this observation , male bats had higher odds of Bartonella infection but did not differ in their bat fly intensities compared to females . Weak correspondence between bat fly intensity at the time of sampling and Bartonella infection thus may cast doubt on bat flies as a primary transmission route . Time lags could provide one reason for this discrepancy , given that new Bartonella infections may take days or weeks to develop and become detectable and over which time ectoparasite load may have changed due to the mobile nature of bat flies [ 26 , 36 , 79 ] . On the other hand , it is possible that vector presence ( rather than abundance ) is a more important driver of transmission . Unfortunately , nearly all bats in this study had ectoparasites , so comparisons of Bartonella presence in bats with and without bat flies had little statistical power ( 31 / 36 Bartonella - positive bats were infested with at least one bat fly ) . Given that ectoparasitism predicted Bartonella infection more generally across a Mexian bat community [ 16 ] , larger sample sizes with greater variation in bat fly intensity could provide better inference . However , our phylogenetic analysis does provide a tentative line of evidence supporting vector - borne transmission , as several of Bartonella genotypes fell within the same clade as Bartonella from streblid bat flies [ 29 ] . A recent survey of Mexican bats and their sympatric bat flies suggested that corresponding hosts and their bat flies had varied Bartonella genotypes , although one vampire bat did show complete sequence homology with the Bartonella from its paired bat flies [ 37 ] . As genetic similarity between Bartonella in bat flies and hosts has been interpreted as evidence of vector - borne transmission in other bat species [ 29 , 54 ] , further assessments of Bartonella genotypes between vampire bats and their various ectoparasites ( bat flies but also ticks ) would shed additional light on possible routes of vector - borne transmission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 323}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 467, "end": 478}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 628, "end": 650}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1205, "end": 1220}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1230, "end": 1251}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
