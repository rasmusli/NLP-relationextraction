Indeed , the EV - D68 Fermon strain displayed significant ability to increase the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 phase . The EV - D68 Fermon strain was isolated in the United States in 1962 ( Schieble et al . , 1967 ) , but currently circulating strains , including EV - D68 US / MO / 14 - 18947 and US / KY / 14 - 18953 , may be more relevant to current human health . Therefore , we examined whether these two currently circulating strains had similar ability to manipulate the cell cycle . Our results confirmed that the circulating EV - D68 strains manipulate the cell cycle in a similar manner as does the Fermon strain , though the current strains have higher virulence than Fermon . Therefore , after more than 50 years ' evolution , EV - D68 still possesses the ability to arrest cells at G0 / G1 phase but EV - D68 virulence has increased .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
