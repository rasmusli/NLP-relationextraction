Typically , an HPC setup operates in a cluster computing environment consisting of multiple computers that communicate over fast switches . For popular database scanning applications such as BLAST and HMMER the benefits of clusters are immediate and linear speedups can be easily achieved . However , the evolving challenges in life sciences cannot be all addressed by off - the - shelf bioinformatics applications . Life scientists need to analyze their data using novel approaches published in recent journals or based on their own hypotheses and assumptions . Quascade - MP2 has been developed to address this need . It is a visual prototyping tool created especially for data - driven , high performance scientific applications .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
