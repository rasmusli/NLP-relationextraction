Since the SARS - CoV may retain its infectivity for minutes and gradual loss for as long as several days [ 40 , 41 ] , the viability function of the SARS - CoV is taken as 75 % after aerosolization and remains the same during the first a few minutes [ 22 , 40 , 41 ] . m is the total number of size bins . N c is the total quantity of pathogens produced in a cough , N c = V c c , where V c is the total volume of the droplets produced in a cough , 6 . 7 \u00d7 10 - 3 ml [ 18 , 42 ] h l is the ratio of the number of droplets of the lth size bin in a cough to the number of injected particles in the numerical model , in which the number of droplets of the lth size bin can be calculated according to the original size distribution of the cough and V c . v ( x , t ) is the volume density of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of the subject induced by one cough , ml / l of air . The breathing zone of each passenger can be defined as a hemisphere with 0 . 3 m radius at the nose [ 18 ] . For the human model used in this work , the volume of the breathing zone is 0 . 005721 m 3 for each passenger . Then v ( x , t ) can be calculated according to the CFD simulation results as the total volume of all the expiratory droplets in the breathing zone divided by the volume of the breathing zone [ 43 ] . \u03b2 l is the respiratory deposition fraction of the aerosols of the lth size bin , % , which can be calculated according to the size and deposition location of the aerosols [ 44 ] . According to the infection mechanism of SARS , the human angiotensin 1 - converting enzyme 2 ( hACE2 ) has been confirmed to be the receptor of the SARS - CoV . The hACE2 can be detected in ciliated airway epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions . And the infectivity of the SARS - CoV on the ciliated airway epithelial cells derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions shows no difference [ 45 ] . So the aerosols that deposit in the head airway and tracheobronchial regions of the respiratory tract can be accounted in the intake dose [ 44 ] . It was tedious and time - consuming to model every cough during the exposure time interval to obtain v ( x , t ) at different locations . Considering other aerodynamic size - dependent factors , a stochastic non - Table 4 The cases investigated in the numerical simulation threshold dose - response model for airborne pathogens can be formed [ 38 ] :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1789, "end": 1831}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1833, "end": 1839}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1903, "end": 1909}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
