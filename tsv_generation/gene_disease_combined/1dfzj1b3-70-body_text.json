There are several ways to ascertain the ability to form hydroxyl radicals . One of them is the deoxyribose test . This method includes a mixture of ferric chloride ( FeCl 3 ) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , which in the presence of ascorbic acid forms Fe 2 + - EDTA , and oxidized form of ascorbic acid . After addition of hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , Fe 3 + - EDTA and HO \u2022 are formed . This is the so - called Fenton reaction , which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical ( Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2 \u2192 Fe 3 + + HO \u2212 + HO \u2022 ) . Hydroxyl radicals that are not scavenged by any component of the mixture attack the deoxyribose and degrade it into several fragments . Some of these fragments are capable of reacting with thiobarbituric acid after heating and in an acidic pH , originating a pink pigment that can be quantified by spectrophotometry [ 5 ] . There are other methods that did not use deoxyribose but other components such as benzoic acid or safranine . Using these methods several authors have evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of essential oils [ 51 , 53 , 54 , 57 , 83 , 84 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
