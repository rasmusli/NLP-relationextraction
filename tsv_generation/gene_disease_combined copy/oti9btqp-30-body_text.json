Briefly , the spleens from mice were collected individually in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS ( R10 ) , then processed with a Stomacher 80 paddle blender ( A . J . Seward and Co . Ltd . ) for 30 s on high speed . The processed spleen samples were filtered through 45 mm nylon filters and then centrifuged at 1 , 500g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0 C . The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ACK ( ammonium - chloride - potassium ) lysis buffer ZIKA virus prM envelope - based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al ( Life Technologies ) for 5 min at room temperature , and PBS was then added to stop the reaction . The samples were again centrifuged at 1 , 500g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0 C . The cell pellets were resuspended in R10 and then passed through a 45 mm nylon filter before use in ELISpot assay and flow cytometric analysis . 25 For RM , blood ( 20 ml at each time point ) was collected in EDTA tubes and the PBMCs were isolated using a standard Ficoll - hypaque procedure with Accuspin tubes ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Five millilitres of blood was also collected into sera tubes at each time point for sera isolation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
