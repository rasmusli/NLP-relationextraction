Weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models , and previous work indicates that they provide good prediction of mean epidemic sizes , though may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks [ 38 ] . The advantage with a weighted static network approach is that it is possible to determine the epidemic impact independent of time of year . However , there is clear seasonality observed in the cattle movement network [ 49 ] , and it is therefore possible that a weighted static network could result in an under - or over - prediction of epidemic size . Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the preferred sampling strategies are robust , although the proportion of nodes that need to be sampled may vary dependent upon time of year . Future studies will focus upon constructing rspb . royalsocietypublishing . org Proc . R . Soc .
