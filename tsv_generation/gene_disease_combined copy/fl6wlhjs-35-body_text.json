The first day of the outbreak was randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the period December 5th , 2003 to June 22nd , 2004 . ( Making the earliest date later than November 1st , 2003 , guarantees enough data for the filter - based methods to work with a prediction window of m = 28 days ) . In the absence of other information ( e . g . , Buckeridge , et al . [ 16 ] do not report their probabilities ) we set the ED utilization probabilities to be : P d = 0 . 25 ( weekday entry probability at the prodromal stage ) ; P w = 0 . 4 ( weekend entry probability at the prodromal stage ) and P f = 0 . 80 ( entry probability at the fulminant stage ) . The daily drop - out probability was set at 0 . 05 . We assumed that with probability 0 . 9 , the infected persons that enter the ED for the first time during a given outbreak receive a chest radiograph , i . e . , 10 % of the infected persons are misdiagnosed at the first visit . In a subsequent visit , 5 % of the infected persons that re - enter the ED are misdiagnosed . The misdiagnosis additive factor , C , was assumed to be 0 . 05 . We added the counts from the ED visits and subsequent number of chest radiographs generated from the healthcare utilization model on each day during the outbreak period .
