Total energy - related carbon emissions mainly include two parts , namely , carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion and out of the boundary embodied in the imported electricity ( Fig 3 ) . Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity need to be calculated by considering the total amount of imported electricity and the corresponding emissions factor of power generation The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model [ 56 ] . As for China ' s power supply system , electricity is supplied by the main six regional grids five - year plan period , respectively . ) , which were issued by the central government and performed by the local government . But in fact , carbon emissions mitigation in the boundary mainly benefited from contributions of the imported electricity from the neighbors Guizhou and Yunnan provinces via the cross - province electricity trades . During the same period , carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity dramatically increased 3 . 236 million tons in 2010 to 4 . 379 million tons in 2013 . Rapidly increasing carbon emissions embodied in imported electricity indicated that there were large amounts of fossil energy were burned for power . Final products - thermal power was consumed in Guangzhou , while carbon emissions were discharged in its neighbor producers . If these carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity were allocated to the final consumer , Guangzhou would have paid more efforts and implemented more strict mitigation measures to achieve its energy saving and emission reduction targets .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
