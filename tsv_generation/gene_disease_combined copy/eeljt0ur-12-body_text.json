Of the 56 cats , 4 did not meet the initial pre - diagnostic inclusion criteria . On day 0 , 52 cats were randomized to 1 of the 2 study diets , of which 17 were found to either violate the inclusion or meet the exclusion criteria based on the results of the diagnostic screening . Seven cats dropped out of the study prior to the day 28 visit . Reasons for dropping out included unwillingness to eat the diet in four cats ( two cats fed Diet A and two cats fed Diet B ) , withdrawn by owner due to continued diarrhea in two cats ( one fed Diet A for 1 day and one fed Diet B for 4 days ) , and one owner declined to participate following screening for one cat . The final study population of 28 cats included 13 cats fed Diet A and 15 cats fed Diet B . One of the cats in the Diet A group was inadvertently given the wrong diet after 2 weeks ; therefore , data for this cat were included for only the first 2 weeks of the feeding period .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 579}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
