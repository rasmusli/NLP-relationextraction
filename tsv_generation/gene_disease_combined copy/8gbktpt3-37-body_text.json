This finding , together with the detection of additional Australian FPVs ( Clades B and D ) , is consistent with multiple independent virus entries into Australia , including the virus from an unvaccinated cat ( clade D ) , which was seemingly derived from an FPV vaccine strain . Three recently vaccinated cats , in which the same vaccine virus was detected ( clade D ) , likely did not have FPL , including two with Giardia co - infections initially diagnosed with FPL from a positive commercial faecal qPCR assay . MLV vaccine virus shed in faeces can be detected in qPCR assays and CPV faecal antigen tests [ 22 , 23 ] . Quantifying viral loads can assist in the discrimination of vaccine and field strains . However , quantification data were not provided by the commercial laboratory for these two cases . CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are 4 - to 5 - fold lower than those of dogs infected with field strains [ 24 ] . Similarly , a recent report found several recently vaccinated cats had low FPV viral loads ( < 1 . 38 \u00d7 10 2 copies / mg of faeces ) over a 28 - day period of surveillance [ 23 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 23}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 588}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 617}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 662}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
