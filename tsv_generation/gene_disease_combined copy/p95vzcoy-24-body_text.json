It may well be that the treatment colonies would eventually reach a low viral level such as the controls , display low level replication and at that both A and B strains are present . However , we have no data to address those questions . What could explain the observed decrease of viral titers over time ? Neither altruistic self - removal of infected nestmates [ 70 ] nor increased mortality in the treatment colonies were observed . Therefore , the higher initial viral titers and the more common minus - strand presence could reflect virus particles consumed with the infected honeybee food . In light of ant physiology [ 71 ] , this is nevertheless unlikely to explain the comparatively high viral titers and especially the presence of the minus strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus - infected food has been consumed . The most parsimonious explanation therefore is that the ants were fed with highly virus saturated honeybee pupae resulting in initial viral peaks , then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected ant individuals later . In light of these results , it appears as if controlled laboratory experiments are required before drawing general conclusions on the role of predators / scavengers as alternative hosts of any honeybee viruses , i . e . , the timing of the last virus - infected food consumption should be known . Similarly , the detection of the negative - sense strand in V . destructor suggested DWV replication in the mites until recently , when a non - propagative manner DWV transmission has been proposed [ 72 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
