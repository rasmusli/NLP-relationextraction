In the last decades , proteins and nucleic acid molecules have shown very promising antiviral properties . However , due to their physical properties , such as size or hydrophilicity , the cellular uptake of these molecules is strongly restricted . The inability of these molecules to cross the cell membrane to reach their intracellular target precludes further clinical application . The cellular delivery of these molecules has thus arisen as a cornerstone for therapeutic development .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 137}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
