Potential risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire and investigation of throat and rectal S . suis carriage in cases , controls and their pigs , using real - time PCR and culture of swab samples . We recruited 101 cases of S . suis meningitis , 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls . By multivariate analysis , risk factors identified for S . suis infection as compared to either control group included eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes , including such dishes as undercooked pig blood and pig intestine ( OR 1 = 2 . 22 ; 95 % CI = [ 1 . 15 - 4 . 28 ] and OR 2 = 4 . 44 ; 95 % CI = [ 2 . 15 - 9 . 15 ] ) , occupations related to pigs ( OR 1 = 3 . 84 ; 95 % CI = [ 1 . 32 - 11 . 11 ] and OR 2 = 5 . 52 ; 95 % CI = [ 1 . 49 - 20 . 39 ] ) , and exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries ( OR 1 = 7 . 48 ; 95 % CI = [ 1 . 97 - 28 . 44 ] and OR 2 = 15 . 96 ; 95 % CI = [ 2 . 97 - 85 . 72 ] ) . S . suis specific DNA was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples , but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without S . suis infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1081, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 408}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 535}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 976}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1283, "end": 1302}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
