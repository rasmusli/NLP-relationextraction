Mice were fed PLX5622 chow or control chow for 2 weeks , then i . c . infected with WNV - NS5 - E218A ( 10 4 PFU ) . At 8 dpi , leukocytes were analyzed from the cortex . a Representative flow cytometry contour plots of P2RY12 expression on CD45 + - gated cells to identify resident microglia ( P1 ) . b Representative flow cytometry plots of CD11b expression on P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells to identify infiltrating macrophages ( P2 ) . c , d Representative flow cytometry plots of MHCII expression on c P1 microglia and d P2 macrophages . e , f Representative flow cytometry plots of CD80 expression on e P1 microglia and f P2 macrophages . g , h Representative flow cytometry dot plots of CD86 expression on g P1 microglia and h P2 macrophages . i , j Quantification of flow cytometry analysis of i percentages and j total numbers of P1 - vs P2 - gated cells . k Quantification of percentages and l total numbers of MHCII + CD45 + cells within each P1 and P2 population . m Quantification of percentages and n total number of CD80 + CD45 + cells within each P1 and P2 population . o Quantification of percentages and p total numbers of CD86 + CD45 + cells within each P1 and P2 population . For quantification panels , each symbol represents an individual control - ( black ) or PLX5622 - treated ( red ) mouse , and bars indicate mean \u00b1 SEM . Data presented are the compilation of two independent experiments with seven to nine mice per group . Statistical significance was calculated using multiple t tests with Welch ' s correction .
