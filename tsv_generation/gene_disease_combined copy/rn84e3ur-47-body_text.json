Figure 11 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 4 ~ 5 . The index patient was walking ( e . g . towards the lavatory ) and coughed at different location . Same as the intake fraction distribution shown in Figure 6 , local area around the index patient has a significantly higher intake dose than further area . The intake fraction and the infection risk of each passenger is mainly depended on the distance between the passenger and the cough location . Thus , if the index patient coughs during walking in the aisle or waiting outside the lavatory , another high - dose region will be formed around the current location of the index patient , rather than the seat location ( 9E ) . The frequent walking of the index patient may influence the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin and increase the infection risk of the passengers who are seated far from the seat location of the index patient . Passengers who are seated close to the lavatory may also have significantly high infection risks for the index patient may need to use the lavatory frequently . Thus the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin is also highly depended on the behavior characteristics of the index patient . The risk assessment results will be more accurate when considering the droplets dispersion process under different walking activities of the index patient . So a better understanding and estimation of the behavior characteristics of the index patient will be very important and useful for infection risk assessment and control in airplane cabin .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
