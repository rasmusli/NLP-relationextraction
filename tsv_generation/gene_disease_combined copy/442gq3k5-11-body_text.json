As detection of potential carriage in cases and hospital controls could be affected by their antimicrobial treatment , household members were also studied for carriage of S . suis serotype 2 since if carriage and associated transmission were to occur , household members of carriers are the most likely to become positive . Adult household members , defined as any adult ( at least 15 years old ) who resided for at least 50 % of the week in the same house as the case or control , were identified either at the HTD , when taking care of a case or hospital control , or during the household visits . From each household , we choose a maximum of three adult household members from whom we took throat and rectal swabs in the same way as for the cases and controls , following written informed consent . For all cases and controls who reported exposure to pigs at home , sampling of the pigs was performed in collaboration with the Sub - department of Animal Health of Ho Chi Minh City . Swab samples were taken from all pigs present ( except pregnant sows to avoid stress - induced miscarriage ) within 4 weeks of admission of the patient , or at the second visit to the community controls .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
