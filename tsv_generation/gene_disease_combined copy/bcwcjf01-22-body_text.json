Since it is difficult to determine de novo mutations without complete sampling of an outbreak , we focused on those consensus mutations that 1 ) showed inversion between the historical and outbreak samples and 2 ) led to changes in the amino acids . Historical samples were defined as those collected between 1995 and 2000 . Eleven loci were found to have such amino acid inversions , their frequency distributions for the historical and outbreak haplotypes are shown in Figure 5 A and B respectively . Although the frequencies of these two haplotypes sum up to 100 % at a given loci in all samples ( except for outlier entries colored white indicating no data and black indicating absence of these two haplotypes and presence of a third haplotype ) , the dominant haplotype tended to be near 100 % ( values below 100 % have a median of 99 . 86 % ) and the minor variant had extremely low presence ( median 0 . 15 % , therefore could not be visualized if only one heatmap was presented ) . The outbreak haplotypes ( shown in black letters at the bottom of the heatmaps ) began as low frequency variants ( 0 . 04 % to 6 . 03 % ) in the historical samples and rose sometime between 2003 and 2009 to become the dominant haplotypes ( 94 % - 100 % ) in most of the outbreak samples ( Fig . 5B ) ; while the historical haplotypes ( shown in red letters in the heatmaps ) went from being dominant ( 98 % - 100 % presence ) in the historical samples to low level variants ( 0 . 05 % - 1 . 95 % ) in most of the outbreak samples and even completely disappeared in seven of the outbreak samples ( Fig . 5A ) . These data highlight the dynamic evolution of the rabies genome over time .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 49}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1195, "end": 1203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1533, "end": 1555}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1881, "end": 1895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1881, "end": 1888}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
