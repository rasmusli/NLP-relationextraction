Leaf and flower oils had the best antixidant activities , nevertheless inferior to those of BHT and BHA . The authors [ 46 ] attributed such weak activities to the low level of phenolic compounds ( eugenol in the flowers ) or even their absence ( stem and leaf ) , because the extracts also studied in the present work presented higher activities . Nevertheless it is worthy to refer the similar activities found in leaf and flower oils , in spite of the absence or phenols in leaf oils .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
