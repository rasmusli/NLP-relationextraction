Due to its small prevalence , pleurisy was not considered as single outcome in these analyses . Outcomes at the seasonal level were analysed accordingly with the individual data for each winter season and taking into account the three seasons as a categorical covariate . Outcomes at the individual level were analysed using a logistic regression model . Results are ORs and 95 % CIs . Adjusted ORs are based on including age groups and education as simultaneous categorical covariates . Furthermore , in order to study the stability of the obesity - RTI association with respect to potential confounders , ORs were adjusted by respective variables . Subjects with incomplete covariate data were excluded from multivariate analyses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 231}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 289}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 799}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
