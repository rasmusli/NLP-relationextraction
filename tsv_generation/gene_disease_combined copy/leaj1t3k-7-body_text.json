However these techniques present certain limitations and concerns : low efficiency [ 11 , 15 ] , immunogenicity [ 14 , 15 ] , stability and rapid clearance in bloodstream [ 18 ] for liposomal reagents , and immunogenicity and viral integration on host gene expression for viral vectors [ 15 , 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
