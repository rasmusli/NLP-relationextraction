All rabies reads were initially mapped to GenBank rabies reference sequence GI : 260063801 . This reference sequence was used as the common coordinate system for comparing samples and identifying coding frames . Based on a later observation that this newly sequenced rabies virus genome could differ by approximately 9 % relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox rabies sequence , we checked to see if observed error rates would increase by introducing random mutations at 9 % of the control reference sequence , however , no noticeable increase in error rates were observed , suggesting that read mapping parameters were able to tolerate this rate of divergence . The Binomial error model defines the expected number of non consensus bases that should occur given the assumed PCR and sequencing error rate for a given number of observed reads , using a preset P - value ( set to 0 . 01 with a Bonferonni correction ) . Nonconsensus base calls were made when the number of reads with the rare variant exceeded the expected count threshold [ 17 ] . The sequencing data used in this study including reads and the analysis files used to make all base calls is available at NCBI ' s archive BioProject # PRJNA216100 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 254}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 996}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1175, "end": 1199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 511}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 625}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
