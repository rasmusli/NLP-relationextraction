In the transient simulation , the interaction between the discrete phase and the continuous phase was also considered as the external body forces and computed during the continuous phase iterations [ 22 ] . The particles were tracked using the Lagrangian method along with the flow equations at the end of each time step . The Re - Normalization Group ( RNG ) k - \u03b5 model was used for modeling the turbulence in this computational geometry due to its good accuracy , computing efficiency , robustness and affordability [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] . The Differential Viscosity Model and the Swirl Dominated Flow in the RNG options were also used . An enhanced two - layer wall treatment was employed for the prediction of aerosol deposition [ 24 ] . Wall unit adaptation was applied in wall - adjacent cells when creating the meshes to ensure that the values of the wall unit y + meet the requirements of the enhanced wall treatment [ 22 ] . The turbulent dispersion and the random walking of the aerosols are also considered by using the Thermophoretic Force and the Brownian Motion options in the DPM model . To simulate human movement , the layering meshing scheme of the dynamic mesh method was used [ 13 , 17 , 28 ] . The whole mesh domain was split into two mesh zones : stationary zone and dynamic zone [ 11 ] , as shown in Figure 1 . The surfaces between the static mesh zone and the dynamic mesh zone are set as grid interfaces . The grid sizes on the two sides of the interfaces are different . The maximum mesh size for the static mesh zones and the dynamic mesh zones is 0 . 03 m and 0 . 05 m , respectively . The data exchange in the interface between the static and dynamic mesh domains was realized by the grid interface principles for the sliding mesh theory [ 11 ] . The semi - implicit method for pressure - linked equations ( SIMPLE ) algorithm was employed to solve the pressure - velocity coupling equations in the steady - state . The Pressure - Implicit with Splitting of Operators ( PISO ) algorithm was employed for transient simulation . The second order upwind scheme was used for the treatment of the convection and diffusion - convection terms in the governing equation . The method used to simulate human movement has been verified by experimental and numerical investigations [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1824, "end": 1845}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
