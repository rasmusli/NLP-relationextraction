This issue has received more and more attentions from academics . This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission . Methods : The Eulerian - Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols . The dose - response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants . The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions . An in - flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation . A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors . A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants , which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 69}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 225}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 503}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1032, "end": 1037}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
