We decided on a target sample size of 100 cases ( and 300 matched controls ) , corresponding to a recruitment period of approximately 4 years and a target odds ratio for 80 % power of 2 . 1 assuming a probability of exposure in controls of 0 . 25 and a correlation coefficient for exposure between matched cases and controls of at most 0 . 2 . With 100 cases , we also expected to fit reliable multivariate models with up to 10 covariates without over fitting the data [ 11 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 141}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 298}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
