We previously described how DFMO reduces CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ] . Here , we show that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO - mediated polyamine depletion via two distinct and independent mutations . Such emergence of resistance highlights that polyamine depletion as a monotherapy may not be sufficient to quell virus replication . As viruses rapidly mutate and gain resistance to antivirals , potential therapy that includes polyamine depletion would necessitate combination therapy to prevent resistance . Neither protease mutant exhibited an enhanced fitness phenotype , as we had observed with CHIKV mutants [ 31 ] , suggesting that even if this virus were to emerge , the mutation may not fix in a viral population not exposed to DFMO .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 205}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
