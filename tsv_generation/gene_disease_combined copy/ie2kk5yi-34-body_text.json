The presence of Bartonella in saliva samples contrasts with previous work showing an absence of Bartonella in vampire bat saliva [ 44 , 81 ] , providing evidence for possible direct transmission . Bartonella in fecal samples could also suggest environmental transmission between bats [ 18 ] . Both saliva - borne and fecal - oral transmission of vampire bat Bartonella could further pose potential risks to humans or livestock , either through bites during feeding or by environmental exposure of humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [ 18 , 38 , 48 , 82 ] . For the former pathway , however , a recent survey of Bartonella in Mexican ruminants did not identify being bitten by vampire bats as a risk factor for infection [ 81 ] , and our phylogenetic results provide relatively more support for the possibility of vector - borne transmission . Vector - borne transmission of vampire bat Bartonella might reduce their potential to infect humans or livestock , given the high host specificity of most bat flies [ 31 , 32 ] . However , ectoparasite transfer between individuals could still occur during pupal deposition and close contact [ 83 ] , facilitating Bartonella transmission within vampire bat colonies and to other bat species . While our analyses of ectoparasitism only considered bat flies , we have observed heavy tick burdens of vampire bats in other field sites ( e . g . , Belize ) . Bartonella has been detected in ticks infesting other bats [ 28 ] , and these ectoparasites could also be more likely to facilitate cross - species transmission [ 30 ] . Metagenomics also potentially identified Bartonella ancashensis and B . bacilliformis in vampire bat fecal samples , and these species cause notable infectious disease in humans likely through phlebotomine sand flies in Andean regions of Peru [ 84 , 85 ] . Controlled infection trials and more extensive phylogenetic analyses of Bartonella in vampire bats , their various ectoparasites , and sympatric prey are therefore needed to examine the contributions of different transmission routes for bacterial spread within vampire bats and to recipient prey and to confirm whether saliva and feces represent viable transmission routes . Given the high rates of bat bites and proximity to wildlife , humans , and domestic animals that define vampire bat ecology , such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures would elucidate Bartonella transmission dynamics in this common host species and the risks of cross - species transmission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 33}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 548}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1109}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1927, "end": 1946}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
