The number of emerging zoonoses and the geographic distribution of previously known zoonotic pathogens have increased in recent decades [ 15 , 16 ] . More than half of all infectious diseases that affect human populations ( 60 % ) result from pathogens that are shared with animals , both wild and domestic , and 75 % of emerging zoonotic diseases are attributed to pathogens with origins in wildlife reservoirs [ 16 , 17 ] . Rapid modification of the environment and human encroachment promotes interactions between humans , domestic animals , and wildlife species , facilitating disease spillover and presenting a challenge to global health and food security in addition to wildlife conservation [ 18 ] . These shared drivers of disease emergence and biodiversity loss are increasingly recognized as warranting a coordinated approach to monitor , detect , and mitigate changes in ecological conditions that may result in increased disease risk [ 19 ] . The utility of integrated biodiversity monitoring and disease surveillance was recently highlighted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity as a pathway to strengthen conservation relevance of One Health policies and research agendas [ 20 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 395}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 551}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
