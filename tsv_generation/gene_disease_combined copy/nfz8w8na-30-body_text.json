Both the puddles created during heavy rainfall and the open barrel water storage during droughts , create ideal breeding places for mosquitos ( Fast et al . 2015 ) . Since the causes of climate change are complex , global , and political , the responses are political , often emphasizing the symptoms of climate change at a local level ( in especially the poor countries ) , rather than addressing the causes at a global level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 158}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 358, "end": 363}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
