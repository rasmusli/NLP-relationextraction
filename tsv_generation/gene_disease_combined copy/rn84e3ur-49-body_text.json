An on - flight outbreak case of SARS is chosen to demonstrate the risk assessment process . The Eulerian - Lagrangian approach is used to simulate the dispersion and deposition of infectious droplets expelled by the index patient . The simulation result shows that human movement improves the mixing of the air in the airplane cabin , strengthens the downward transport of the aerosols , and decreases the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 156}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
