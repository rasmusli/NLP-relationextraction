Our data show that EV - D68 replication is integrally associated with the host cell cycle , though the pattern of regulation differs distinctly from that of EV - A71 . These results further increase the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses and provide a potential target for the treatment and prevention of enterovirus - related diseases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 530}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
