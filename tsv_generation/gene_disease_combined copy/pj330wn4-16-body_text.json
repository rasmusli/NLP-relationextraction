All regions of interest were chosen based on areas where optimal images of moving cilia were visible to the observer . The video sequences were reanalyzed by a second observer . Paired t tests were performed to compare the CBF obtained using the two methods and the Bland - Altman limits of agreement were calculated from the mean difference \u00b1 the 95 % confidence intervals between the two methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 245}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
