Yet human pressures on bat populations are manifold , with rapid land conversion from urban encroachment and agricultural intensification contributing to rapid declines in bat populations globally [ 3 ] . Human pressures are magnified further by overexploitation through unregulated hunting for consumption , inclusion in medicinal remedies ( e . g . , asthma ) [ 56 ] , sport [ 57 ] , and the souvenir trade [ 58 ] . In addition to these relatively widespread threats to bats , regional threats also exist that can lead to indirect killing of bats , or persecution and disturbance of roosting bats . In Western Asia , widespread application of pesticides to control crop pests , including spraying in caves and abandoned buildings occupied by bats [ 59 , 60 ] , and agricultural intensification , which has led to the establishment of irrigation systems that deplete available water in this largely arid region [ 60 ] , have contributed to declines in regional bat populations . A more recent and unique threat to bats in Western Asia is the fraudulent scheme of selling \" bat nests \" on Facebook and other social media platforms , with sellers claiming the \" nests \" contain \" red mercury \" that has healing properties [ 61 ] . There are no documented cases of bats building nests [ 62 ] , yet the perceived notion that bats create such economically valuable structures has likely led to increased cave disturbance , potentially displacing or indirectly killing roosting bats [ 61 ] . This fraud is speculated to have originated in Iran but has quickly grown in popularity in Jordan [ 63 ] and Turkey , Azerbaijan , and Iraq [ 61 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1362, "end": 1372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 648}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 966}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
