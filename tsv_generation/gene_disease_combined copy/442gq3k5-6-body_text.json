The natural habitat of S . suis in pigs is the upper respiratory - , the genital - and alimentary tracts . Based on differences in antigenic properties of the polysaccharide capsule , 33 serotypes have been distinguished to date , among which serotype 2 is most commonly associated with invasive disease in both pigs and humans . To date little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease or the portals of entry in humans . From small case series , the reported risk factor included occupational exposure , such as in slaughter house workers , butchers , and pig breeders , meat processing , and pig transport . It is hypothesized that patients may be infected through minor cuts or abrasions on their skin [ 2 , 6 ] . However , whilst occupational exposure to pigs or pork was documented in 88 % of the European patients described , it was reported in less than 50 % of Asian cases [ 4 , 7 ] , suggesting the contribution of other behavioural or exposure related risk factors in Asian populations , such as culinary habits or close proximity of pigs within households . In addition , whilst it is known that pigs can carry S . suis asymptomatically , it is not known if there is asymptomatic carriage of S . suis in humans , which could potentially contribute to an increased risk of infection , and to the possibilitiy of person - to - person transmission . We conducted a prospective case - control study to identify the risk factors of S . suis infection in Viet Nam .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 466}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1611, "end": 1620}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
