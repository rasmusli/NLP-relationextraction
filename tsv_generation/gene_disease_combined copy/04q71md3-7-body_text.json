This framework enables us to measure the relative contribution of different predictive variables to viral spatial spread . We apply this approach to seasonal H3N2 dynamics and use it to identify key drivers of the global dissemination of influenza viruses . Analysis of different sampling schemes , including one that represents the community structure in global air transportation , provides consistent support for air travel governing the spatial dynamics of seasonal H3N2 infections . Using epidemiological simulations , we further demonstrate that estimates resulting from the merger of human air travel and H3N2 influenza genetics best capture the observed global expansion of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 431}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 881}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
