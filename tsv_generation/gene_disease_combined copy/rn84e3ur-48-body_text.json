In the risk assessment and the likelihood estimation , an average walking possibility is used for all the seated passengers . This is not accurate because each individual may have a unique behavioral characteristic . So investigations on behavioral characteristics of the occupants in the airplane are strongly needed . And also , only the coughing droplets are numerical simulated in this study . Droplets expelled by breathing and sneezing can also influence the infection risk of each individual . An aerosol source model that takes the droplets expelled by multiple respiratory activities into account may also be helpful for better evaluating the aerosol disseminate process in the airplane cabin . The pathogen concentration in the expiratory fluid was considered as constant in this work . Since the volume concentration of the virus varies with the size of the cough droplets , changes of the pathogen concentration in the droplets of different size may also influence the risk assessment results [ 50 ] . Besides , the re - suspension of the aerosols is not considered in this work . During human walking , the movement may lead to the re - suspension of the aerosols from the floor . When taking the re - suspension of the exhaled droplets into consideration , the risk assessment results will be more accurate . However , since the airflow induced by the ventilation system is downward to the outlet ( located on the side wall and close to the floor ) , the re - suspended aerosols can hardly rise to the breathing level of the seated passengers . So the effects of the re - suspended aerosols on the risk assessment results can be considered as insignificant in this case .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
