Here , Bartonella was detected at relatively high prevalence across both study years within each sampling site , and neither year nor its interaction with site were predictive within our analyses . Similarly , no temporal patterns in Bartonella were observed for a limited sample of Myotis mystacinus , Pipistrellus spp . , Myotis daubentonii , and Nyctalus noctula in the United Kingdom [ 41 ] . Such findings contrast with highly seasonal Bartonella infections in rodents , which show high prevalence in summer and fall due to seasonality in birth and ectoparasite intensity [ 39 , 40 ] . The lack of seasonality in our western Peruvian Amazon sample in particular could simply be due to low statistical power ; alternatively , no seasonality in infection could also be explained by the non - seasonal or less - pronounced birth pulses observed for vampire bats ( but see [ 73 ] ) . While high Bartonella prevalence in bats has been proposed to stem from persistent infection [ 15 ] , this seems unlikely , as we observed possible clearance of infection in some recaptured bats . While this could also reflect bacteria DNA loads too low to be detected by PCR , infection risk did not increase with age , as would also be expected if bats could not clear infection [ 74 ] . However , we do note that our sample only contained adult ( n = 162 ) and subadult ( n = 28 ) bats , limiting more robust tests of age - dependent infection . Alternatively , Bartonella infections could be chronic and vary in infection intensity over time or could become latent ( i . e . , be undetectable in erythrocytes but persist in endothelial cells ) , particularly as infection does not appear to confer long - term immunity [ 36 ] . Such explanations could be confronted in future work with larger sample sizes of recaptured bats , multiple assessments of infection status over time , and quantitative PCR .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 491}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 521}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 653}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1097}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1640, "end": 1651}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
