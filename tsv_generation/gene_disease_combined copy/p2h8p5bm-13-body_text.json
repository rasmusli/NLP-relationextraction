The main vector of OHFV is the meadow tick , Dermacentor reticulatus , which can also transmit the virus to humans . However , humans are mainly infected after contact with infected muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus ) which are very sensitive to the infection and often succumb to the infection [ 63 ] . Muskrats develop high viremia which can last for several weeks . Human infection occurs through contact with urine , feces , and blood [ 63 ] . Secretion of OHFV in unpasteurized goat milk has been reported but no milk - borne outbreaks have been observed [ 63 ] . The exact number of annual cases are uncertain because of misdiagnoses and unreported cases , but 165 cases were reported between 1988 and 1997 [ 63 ] . OHFV may cause a biphasic disease ; the initial phase is characterized by high fever , bleeding from the nose , mouth , and uterus . Thirty to fifty percent of the cases experience a second phase characterized by high fever and reappearance of the symptoms from the initial phase . Case fatality rates range from 0 . 5 to 2 . 5 % [ 63 ] . No antiviral treatments are available against OHFV , instead treatment is focused on supportive care to minimize hemorrhage and other complications [ 17 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 808, "end": 825}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 865, "end": 876}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 922}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1004, "end": 1015}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1243, "end": 1254}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
