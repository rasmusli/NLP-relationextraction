In the current MIA model , additional core features of ASD , including restricted and repetitive behavioral patterns , were not investigated 73 . Thus , the effect of maternal H 2 administration on these symptoms remains unknown . The sensorimotor gating abnormality may be evaluated at an older age than was described in the present model , however , this might require changing other factors including the timing of exposure . Since the mouse brain is not considered to be fully mature until 3 weeks of age 74 , the interpretation of the results of behavioral tests in the present study requires considerable caution . In addition , we could not avoid the detrimental effects of maternal separation required for the measurement of body weight on offspring development . However , the separation was performed similarly for the offspring in all three groups , thus any effect should be minimal , and consistent across groups . In humans , it is currently thought that the occurrence of multiple risk factors , including genetic mutations and postnatal exposure to inflammation or other environmental triggers , may be required for the onset of ASD 1 , 38 . Before advancing the clinical application of H 2 , it should be investigated whether H 2 could exert similar effects in so called ' multi - hit ' models . Finally , in the previous and present studies , maternal H 2 administration was performed prior to the LPS exposure ; thus , the therapeutic potential of H 2 remains unclear . Therefore , it might be relevant to evaluate the therapeutic effects of H 2 by administering H 2 to dams after exposure to LPS and in offspring .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 111}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 319}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1197, "end": 1201}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
