Assuming a constant outdoor pollution level and constant penetration efficiency , increasing ventilation directly leads to increased indoor exposures to outdoor pollutants . Even in the case of efficient filtering of particles in the intake air , detailed studies have shown that a substantial fraction of the outdoor air enters indoors via windows , doors , ventilation ducts , and cracks and leaks in the building envelope , leading to much lower actual filtration efficiency [ 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
