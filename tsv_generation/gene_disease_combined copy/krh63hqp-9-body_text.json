There are several factors that influence strain diversity , including the mutation rate , selection , drift , and crossimmunity - mediated competition between strains [ 39 ] . Feguson , et al . [ 39 ] felt that strain - transcending immunity was essential in restricting viral diversity . Ito , et al . [ 42 ] thought that the many side branches died out because they could not compete with the main - trunk lineage viruses . Others have noted the temporal extinction of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes [ 5 ] . Whatever the reason , a hierarchy of strain robustness is evident in the history of influenza viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 803}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
