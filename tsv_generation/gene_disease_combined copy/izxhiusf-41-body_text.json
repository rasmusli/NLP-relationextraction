In the middle ear , biofilm formation has been demonstrated to be one of the major mechanisms for persistence and provides an explanation for unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy [ 39 , 40 ] . Moreover , biofilm formation and intracellular infection are well established mechanisms of NTHi for persistence in the lower airways [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] . Although our study does not provide evidence of biofilm formation in the lower airways of young unresponsive wheezers , our findings of poor response to and frequent relapse after a short course of antibiotic treatment are suggestive for involvement of biofilm . Biofilm formation should be addressed in future studies , because its presence may have consequences for treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 295}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 331}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 831}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
