Vampire bats are of particular concern because they subsist on blood , which could create opportunities for Bartonella transmission to humans and livestock either from bites during blood feeding or through vector sharing facilitated by close proximity [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] . Here , we capitalize on a two - year , spatially replicated study of vampire bats to examine the genetic diversity and infection prevalence of Bartonella , including its geographic structure across the vampire bat range as well as individual and temporal correlates of infection status . To explore possible transmission routes of this bacterial pathogen , we also test for associations between bat fly infestation and Bartonella infection status , which would support vector - borne transmission , and by screening bat saliva and fecal samples for evidence of Bartonella DNA , which would support transmission through bites or grooming and environmental exposure to bacteria shed in feces , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1001, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 77}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 594}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 870}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
