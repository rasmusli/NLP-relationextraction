Analysis of the Illumina ultra - deep sequencing data supported the hypothesis that variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies than variants that did not . In particular , all of the mutations that distinguish the 1995 / 96 haplotype from the 2003 / 10 haplotype were present as rare variants in Fx 31 , the only 2003 sample for which there is deep sequencing Illumina data available . These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral haplotypes and identify rare haplotypes that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change . Figure S1 Coverage of the rabies genome by the two sequencing platforms . Red : Illumina - Eureka genomics . Blue : 454 . Each trace corresponds to coverage for one sample . Color bars at the bottom denote locations of the 5 proteins in the rabies genome : N , P , M , G , L ( from the left to right ) . Illumina data was generated using overlapping read pairs ( ORP ) . ORP analysis is a new method that assesses genome position specific sequencing error . The approach uses paired - end sequencing to sequence a single DNA fragment twice . Sequencing is initiated once from each end of the DNA fragment to produce two distinct sequencer reads . In other applications paired - end sequencing uses larger fragment sizes to ensure that each read generated from the same DNA fragment covers different parts of the molecule to recover more of the original fragment . ORP uses shorter DNA fragments and longer read lengths to maximize the number of bases in the DNA fragment , which are sequenced twice . The redundant sequencing means reads with base calls that disagree with their overlapping pair are recognized as errors and are discarded to effectively lower the sequencing error rate . A position specific base call supported by a read pair can still disagree with the consensus base call leading to detection of rare variants . ORPs provide an important benefit over the alternative of adding higher sequencer coverage since the detected mismatches between read pairs give an empirically derived sequencing error rate , which is specific to each sequencer run . shown . The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches . Initial tree ( s ) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows . When the number of common sites was , 100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites , the maximum parsimony method was used ; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used .
