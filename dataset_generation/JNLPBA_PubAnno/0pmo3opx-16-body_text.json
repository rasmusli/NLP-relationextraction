For flow cytometry , we synthesized a fluorophore - containing version of the peptide possessing a ( Gly ) 4 - FITC group coupled to the C - terminal cysteine ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . The expression of cell surface - associated APN was examined in the androgen receptor negative neuroendocrine prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 using a commercially available antibody . The cell line PC3 was found to express surface - associated APN , whereas no detectable expression was found for the DU145 cell line by this method . When incubated with both cells lines , the FITC labeled cyc - LHSPW peptide preferentially bound to PC3 cells with no noticeable labelling of DU145 cells . The peptide was next tested on frozen PC3 and DU145 tumor xenografts sections . Preferential labeling of the PC3 xenograft section was evident , furthering attesting to the specificity of cyc - LHSPW by fluorescence microscopy . The potential therapeutic efficacy of cyc - LHSPW was next tested in vitro using the PC3 and DU145 cell lines . The APN inhibitor demonstrated a specific and pronounced therapeutic benefit resulting in the decreased clonal survival of PC3 cells . No significant biological effect was observed on either cell line after treatment with the hydrolyzable LHSPW peptide or the cyc - nHSPW derivative . Prior to in vivo therapeutic efficacy studies , a toxicity study was performed with the i . v . administration of cyc - LHSPW . We found that a single high dose of 100 mg / kg was well tolerated by the mice ; however , multiple doses at this concentration , as would be needed , resulted in cachexia . It was found that a dose of 40 mg / kg administered three time a week for four weeks ( t . i . w . x4 ) was well tolerated , i . e . no signs of morbidity . Mice bearing established PC3 and DU145 xenografts were treated systemic via tail vein injection with 40 mg / kg of the tumor homing APN peptide cyc - NGR or the cyc - LHSPW peptide t . i . w . x4 ( Fig . 6B ) . Inhibition of tumor growth in the PC3 xenograft mice treated with cyc - LHSPW was significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) three weeks into the trial when compared to the saline - and cyc - NGR - treated arms . This therapeutic effect persisted to the end of the study with the cyc - LHSPW - treated mice having a tumor volume of 309 . 3 \u00b1 92 . 7 mm 3 at day 35 . Little therapeutic effect was observed in the cyc - NGR - treated mice with both the saline - and cyc - NGR - treated arms having tumor volumes > 1000 mm 3 at the end of the study . PC3 tumors were removed and stained for the cellular proliferation marker Ki67 . Both the saline - and cyc - NGR - treated tumors had profoundly higher populations of K i 67 positive cells compared to the cyc - LHSPW - treated tumors ( Fig . 6C ) . No therapeutic effect observed in the APN - negative DU145 tumors treated with either cyc - LHSPW or cyc - NGR .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 391}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1187, "end": 1191}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
