This result also proves that human movement may increase the infection risk in the airplane cabin . Especially , in case 2 and 3 , the infection risk of the moving person is 0 . 55 for moving speed of 0 . 5 m / s and 0 . 51 for 1 . 0 m / s , significantly higher than most of the seated passengers ( 62 passengers for case 2 and 58 for case 3 ) . This result indicates that the infection possibilities of the crew members ( who need to walk in the airplane cabin frequently during the flight ) may be even higher than 50 % . For the seated passengers , walking along the aisle ( e . g . go to the washroom ) and passing through the high - dose region ( around the index patient ) may also significantly increase their intake doses and result in much higher infection risks .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
