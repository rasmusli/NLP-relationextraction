While subadult status itself was not an important predictor of Bartonella infection , these findings could suggest higher risk in young male bats that are relatively large for their age . Our previous work has shown stronger innate immune defense ( i . e . , bacterial killing ability ) in reproductive ( mostly male ) vampire bats , also suggesting greater susceptibility of non - reproductive hosts [ 49 ] . Similarly , subadults across a Mexican bat community also had higher odds of Bartonella infection [ 16 ] , and young male vampire bats play key roles in the long - distance dispersal of rabies virus [ 43 ] and display higher rates of rabies exposure , possibly owing to more direct contacts during the first year of life [ 75 ] . Larger forearm size could also relate to direct contact if larger bats are more dominant and aggressive , as found in other phyllostomid bat species [ 76 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
