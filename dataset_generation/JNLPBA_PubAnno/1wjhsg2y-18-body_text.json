Specifically , the 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 ( 67 % ) geographic regions designated by IUCN , with over 90 % of all species distributed in more than one region ( Table S2 ) . For example , Pipistrellus tenuis is Emirates ; YEM - Yemen . Shapefiles of species ' ranges were extracted using the package raster [ 105 ] and converted to raster files using package fasterize [ 106 ] . Rasterized polygons of species ' ranges were cropped to include only Western Asian countries based on ISO 3166 two - letter codes and mapped using packages maptools [ 107 ] and viridis [ 108 ] . All analyses were conducted in R version 3 . 4 . 3 [ 109 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
