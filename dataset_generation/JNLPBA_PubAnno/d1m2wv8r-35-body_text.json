Furthermore , to clarify the protein alterations of each time points , a two - tailed unpaired t test that included a p - value < 0 . 05 and a fold - change ratio between a given time point and the mock ( 114 ) passing the threshold was used for screening the DEPs at the different time points ( Method 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 545}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
