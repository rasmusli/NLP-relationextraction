These are a prominent feature of many childhood epidemics and an early presentation of diseases like avian influenza , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , and inhalational anthrax that have recently come to the public ' s attention . Unfortunately , respiratory complaints are also a feature of many common childhood illnesses , reducing the ability of biosurveillance systems to detect epidemics of greater public health concern . What is needed , therefore , is clinical information that is readily accessible and pre - processed in a manner that reflects the severity and aberrancy of respiratory symptoms . Using such data , discrimination between common childhood diseases and more serious respiratory epidemics would be possible .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
