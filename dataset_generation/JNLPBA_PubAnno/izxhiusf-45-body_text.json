{"cord_uid": "izxhiusf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3420249", "divid": "45", "text": "In preschool children with persistent wheezing unresponsive to adequate inhaled asthma treatment , bacterial infection is frequent , with NTHi , S . pneumoniae and M . catarrhalis being the main pathogens involved . These microbiological findings and the presence of a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation in BAL - fluid , sampled in patients not presenting an acute exacerbation episode , favours the hypothesis that chronic bacterial infection is an ongoing inflammatory stimulus providing a possible explanation for persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy in these young patients . These elements suggest that the use of antibiotic treatment , although not currently recommended , should be considered in selected young children presenting with chronic wheezing . However , as these patients are indistinguishable without the use of invasive procedures , and biofilm formation and other escape mechanisms may decrease the bactericidal efficacy of antibiotic treatment , additional research is necessary before specific treatment recommendations can be provided . Future research should focus on population characteristics , determination of risk factors for acquisition of bacterial bronchial infection , pathogenicity mechanisms of chronic bronchial infection and possible prevention and treatment strategies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
