While the literature presents obviously competing narratives that explain disease outbreaks , a close examination of these reveals a high prevalence of certain narratives , which reflect the influence of power and privilege . Hence , some of the literature has called for increased representation of the narratives from the most marginalized populations who bear the brunt of epidemics , in the scholarly literature ( Dry and Leach 2010 ; Nightingale 2010 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
