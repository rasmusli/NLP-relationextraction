Thus , we compared the clinicolaboratory findings between Adv and Non - Adv group patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment ( Table 4 ) . The number of patients who did not a response to initial antibiotics treatment was 47 and 50 in the Adv and Non - Adv groups , respectively . The percentage of patients having leukocytosis and monocytopenia was higher in the Adv patients , although there was no significant difference in white blood cell and platelet counts between the two groups . Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia , which were a showed a significant difference in all study patients , showed no difference in patients with unresponsiveness to initial antibiotics treatment ( P = 0 . 720 , P = 0 . 733 , respectively ) . A greater number of Adv group patients exhibited no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non - Adv group patients ( 25 . 5 % vs . 10 . 0 % , P = 0 . 045 ) as well as the number of patients to reach over 40 \u00b0 C and 39 to 40 \u00b0 C ( P = 0 . 003 ) . In addition , the Adv group patients had a higher mean temperature at admission than the Non - Adv group patients ( 37 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 3 vs . 37 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 2 , P = 0 . 005 ) . Table 5 compares the clinicolaboratory variables between the combined Adv ( cAdv ) , Non - Adv , and only Adv identified pathogen ( OAIP ) group patients . Compared to the cAdv and Non - Adv patients , more patients in the OAIP group exhibited the following characteristics : were currently smoking ; had leukopenia , lymphopenia , monocytopenia , and thrombocytopenia ; exhibited a longer duration of fever after symptom onset ; had a higher maximal temperature at admission ( over 40 \u00b0 C and 39 - 40 \u00b0 C ) ; and exhibited no response to antipyretics at admission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
