The start of the section describing the scenarios suggests that ventilation optimization would be \" complemented \" first by filtration and then by source control ( page 9 ) . This suggests that a ventilation optimization component would appear in all scenarios . Choosing just one \" optimal \" ventilation rate makes it difficult to ascertain the relative benefits due to ventilation and source control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
