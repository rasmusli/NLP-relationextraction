Optical power measurements were performed using an 818 - UV / DB low - power UV enhanced silicon photodetector with an 843 - R optical power meter ( Newport , Irvine , CA ) . Additional dosimetry to determine the uniformity of the UV exposure was performed using far - UVC sensitive film as described in our previous work 28 , 29 . This film has a high spatial resolution with the ability to resolve features to at least 25 \u00b5m , and exhibits a nearly ideal cosine response 30 , 31 . Measurements were taken between experiments therefore allowing placement of sensors inside the chamber .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
