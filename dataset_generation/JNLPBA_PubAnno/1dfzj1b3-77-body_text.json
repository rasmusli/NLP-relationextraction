From the 28 essential oils evaluated , only Thymus zygis ssp . sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in diferent places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity > 50 % . In Thymus zygis ssp . sylvestris prevailed thymol or carvacrol , whereas in Thymus capitellatus oils , borneol and 1 , 8 - cineole dominated . Such results seem to indicate that the phenolic compounds are not the only ones able to scavenge superoxide anion , as already reported for hydroxyl radical scavenging [ 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 131}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
