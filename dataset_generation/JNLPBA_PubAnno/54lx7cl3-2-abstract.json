A wide range of viral , bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia : although viruses are the most common etiologic agent , the severity of clinical symptoms associated with bacterial pneumonia and increasing antibiotic resistance makes bacterial pneumonia a major public health concern . Bacterial pneumonia can follow upper respiratory viral infection and complicate lower respiratory viral infection . Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of influenza - related deaths . In this review , we evaluate the following hypotheses : ( i ) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract ( URT ) and ( ii ) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract ( LRT ) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT . We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions . We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT . However , it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in pneumonia etiology . The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co - infection , increased carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia has been established .
