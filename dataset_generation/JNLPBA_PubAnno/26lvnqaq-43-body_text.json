None of the organs collected on day 18 pi was positive by qRRT - PCR . Figure 1 Laying performance of challenged and control birds in experiment 1 . Eggs were collected throughout the experiment , three times a day , keeping handling of animals to the minimum , in order to avoid the occurrence of stressful events . We compared the egg production between challenged and control birds on a weekly basis , adopting the Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - ranks on daily mean values for each group . Significance level was set at P < 0 . 05 . Data are shown here as mean \u00b1 standard deviations . The differences in the weekly egg production between the two groups were significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) for 9 weeks after the challenge .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
