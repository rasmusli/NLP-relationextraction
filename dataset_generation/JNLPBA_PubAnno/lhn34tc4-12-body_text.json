The data reported in this paper are derived from a subset of 15 survey items specifically designed to measure public attitudes towards the use of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks . These items addressed issues ranging from the legality of restrictive measures , the perceived effectiveness of quarantine , and the supports that should be supplied to those affected by quarantine orders . Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement / disagreement with each item ; the response format was a 5 - point Likert - type design ( 1 = \" Strongly Disagree \" ; 2 = \" Somewhat Disagree \" ; 3 = \" Neutral \" ; 4 = \" Somewhat Agree \" ; and 5 = \" Strongly Agree \" ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
