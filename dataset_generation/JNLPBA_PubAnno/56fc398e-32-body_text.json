{"cord_uid": "56fc398e", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4455802", "divid": "32", "text": "As the transmission rate of the disease increases , epidemic sizes increase and a higher percentage of nodes are required for all sampling methods to make accurate predictions . For example when b \u00bc 2 , 25 % of the nodes must be sampled using the TNS method and 50 % for the SBS method to predict the overall epidemic size for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria , whereas for the RNS method almost all nodes must be sampled to capture epidemic behaviour ( electronic supplementary material , figure S13 ) . As the infectious period of the disease increases , a higher percentage of nodes needs to be sampled , but the effect of this is less pronounced than a variation in the transmission rate ( electronic supplementary material , figures S14 and S15 ) . For diseases with a very high transmission rate , a much higher percentage of nodes must be sampled for all methods , even when the infectious period is short ( electronic supplementary material , figure S16 ) . When we include within - market transmission into our model , we observe significantly larger epidemic sizes , with the mean epidemic size after one infectious period when b \u00bc 1 and T \u00bc 21 being 2266 farms for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria . The TNS and SBS methods under - predict epidemic sizes when less than 35 % and 50 % respectively of the nodes are sampled ( electronic supplementary material , figure S7 ) . In contrast to the scenario where markets do not amplify transmission , the RMS method predicts epidemic sizes accurately even when only a very small number ( approx . 20 % ) of movements are sampled . This suggests that , if a significant level of transmission is thought to occur within markets , then either TNS or RMS would be the preferred strategies if only limited resources were available . Similar results are observed for outbreaks seeded in Devon and Aberdeenshire .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
