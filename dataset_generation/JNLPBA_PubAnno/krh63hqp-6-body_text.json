This includes the bacteriophage MS2 [ 14 ] , the tobacco etch virus [ 15 ] , HIV [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] , dengue virus type - 2 [ 20 ] , Ebola [ 21 , 22 ] , and SARS [ 23 , 24 ] . Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation ( \" lethal mutagenesis \" ) may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain extinction [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] . There is some long - term historical evidence that supports the concept of natural viral attenuation through mutation accumulation [ 2 ] , and theoretical studies using numerical simulation strongly support the concept of natural and accelerated genetic attenuation of RNA viruses [ 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
