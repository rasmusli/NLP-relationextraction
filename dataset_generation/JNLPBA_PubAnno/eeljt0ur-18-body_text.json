It was considered that there may have been a lack of awareness or appreciation of diarrhea in the cats given the absorptive nature of litter that could have made diarrhea less recognizable to owner . The FCS chart included images of stool within litter to help educate and increase awareness of the owners participating in this study ; however , overall frequency of diarrhea remained low and did not significantly change over the 4 - week period .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
