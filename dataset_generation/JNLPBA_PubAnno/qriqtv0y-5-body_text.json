The cluster Aichivirus A contains Kobuviruses from dogs , cats , rodents , bats and human . While Aichivirus B and C contain Kobuviruses from cattle and pigs , respectively . Based on whole genome sequence , Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from the viruses from the US , UK , Brazil and Tanzania ( Fig . 3 ) . Phylogenetic analysis of 3D and VP1 of Thai CaKoVs and reference CaKoVs from various animal species were also performed . Similarly , 3D gene of Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs ( G1 sub - cluster ) but separated from the viruses in sub - clusters G2 as well as G3 ( Fig . 4 ) . Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene , the viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups , US / EU / Africa subgroup and China / Thailand subgroup ( Fig . 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 555}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 653, "end": 661}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 844, "end": 853}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
