Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [ 56 ] . Gerow et al . [ 57 ] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation , leading to detection of the virus in blood . This reactivation was also associated with a low level of antibodies against the virus . Following hibernation the antibody levels increase , which subsequently drives the virus into latency .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 373}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
