Based on the guaranteed analysis for total omega - 3 fatty acids and inclusion of fish oil ( Table 1 ) , Diet A was expected to provide greater concentrations of long - chain omega - 3 fatty acid . Dietary long - chain omega - 3 fatty acids have been shown to modulate inflammation within the body , providing benefit to a variety of inflammatory medical conditions ( 19 ) . The underlying etiology was not defined in this study ; however , IBD is commonly reported in feline gastroenteropathy , and the use of omega - 3 fatty acids may have a beneficial effect in modulating the inflammatory response ( 19 ) . While the duration of this study was relatively short , fatty acid incorporation into intestinal tissues can occur fairly rapidly , with one study showing significantly higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in human colonic tissue following 7 days of supplementation compared to controls ( 20 ) . Additional studies evaluating diets with titrated levels of long - chain omega - 3 fatty acids are required to better understand potential benefits in cats with chronic gastroenteropathy .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
