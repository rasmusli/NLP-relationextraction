This method relies on substrate hydrolysis , leading to an increase in fluorescence that can be read out in real time . Interestingly , a geranyl ( 3 , 7 - dimethylocta - 2 , 6 - dienyl ) group at the C6 position within the flavonoid was found to be crucial for both inhibi - tory potency and kinetic mechanism . For example , diplacone showed a 150 - fold higher efficacy ( IC 50 = 0 . 11 mM ) than eriodictyol , a parent flavonoid lacking a geranyl group ( IC 50 = 16 . 4 mM ) ( Table 2 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 , diplacone showed competitive kinetics , with a K i value of 0 . 04 mM . Diplacone also acted as a time - dependent inhibitor .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 125}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
