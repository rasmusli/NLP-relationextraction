It is well known that numerous factors can cause a breakdown in the selective removal of deleterious mutations . These factors include a high mutation rate , a high rate of random loss , limited sexual recombination , genetic bottlenecking , and mutations with very small fitness effects . All of these factors should be especially pronounced in an RNA virus such as influenza and all of these are either previously known or documented here . The genetic changes in H1N1 appear non - directional and are distributed quite uniformly across the genome ( Additional file 3 ) , consistent with an accumulation of low - impact deleterious mutations . Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis are already recognized as a threat to any RNA virus . These facts , combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain extinction , all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
