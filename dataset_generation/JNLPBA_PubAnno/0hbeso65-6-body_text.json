It has been estimated that approximately 20 % of recipients will progress to graft cirrhosis within 5 years of transplant [ 7 ] . Overall , HCV disease is more aggressive in the posttransplant recipients than in patients whose immunity is intact [ 8 ] . Accelerated disease progression is multifactorial and probably depends on a number of variables , including host , donor , viral , and external factors . However , the definite interactions between these factors and recurrent HCV infection in the liver allograft still remain controversial and poorly defined . Thus , to identify recipients at risk for rapid HCV recurrence after LT will be helpful especially when considering treatment with the currently available antiviral agents either as prophylaxis or therapy . To date , a number of risk factors have been mentioned regarding this clinical issue .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
