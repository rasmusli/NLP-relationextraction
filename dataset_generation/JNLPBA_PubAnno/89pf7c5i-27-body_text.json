Lymphadenomegaly may be solitary or multicentric . Ocular lesions have been reported in approximately one third of the affected cats . Uveitis , either unilateral or bilateral ( Fig . 1 ) , is the most common ocular lesion described , with occasionally a pseudotumoral granulomatous pattern and eventually progress to panophthalmitis [ 50 , 53 , 55 , 64 , 69 ] . Blepharitis and conjunctivitis have also been described in a number of clinical cases [ 66 , 68 , 70 ] . Amastigotes have been found by cytology in conjunctival nodules , corneal infiltrates and aqueous humor , and by histopathology after enucleation of the eye or post mortem even in uveal tissue [ 50 , 53 , 55 , 64 , 69 ] . Chronic gingivostomatitis is also a common clinical finding and has been found in about one fourth of the cats so far studied with leishmaniosis ( Fig . 2 ) [ 11 , 26 , 53 , 55 , 63 , 66 , 70 ] . Nodular lesions are unfrequently seen on the gingival mucosa or the tongue [ 60 , 66 , 69 , 71 ] , where infected macrophages may be visualized in lesion biopses [ 60 , 69 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
