Furthermore , the infected bats remained viremic and shed infectious virus for up to three weeks , after which there was no detectable virus in blood , oral swabs and urine samples . Despite the lack of detectable virus , even four months after initial infection , experimentally inoculated bats were able to transmit the virus to other contact bats [ 43 ] . One of the ways in which this can be explained is that Marburg virus persisted in the bats ( probably in the spleen [ 42 ] ) , and a decrease in antibody levels led to increase in viral load which could then be shed to infect other bats / animals . A bat coronavirus was also shown to persistently infect North American little brown bats ( Myotis lucifugus ) [ 44 ] . Little brown bats in captivity were able to harbor the coronavirus in their intestines and lungs during hibernation for a period of four months . In addition , there was no significant pathology seen in the bat tissues .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
