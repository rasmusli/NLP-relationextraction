Our results demonstrate a higher infectivity and level of replication for the Laos strain in both porcine NEC and macrophages . Associated with this was also a higher level of induced innate immune responses in epithelial cells . The reason for these strain - related differences is unknown , and strain and genotype effects require further investigations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
