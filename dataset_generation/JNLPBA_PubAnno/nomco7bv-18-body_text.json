Obesity belongs to one of the host risk factors for RTI and has possibly an emerging role due to the dramatically increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide . In the present study , we report on the association of obesity with individual RTIs as well as with a diary score summarising different incident RTI symptoms over a period of 18 months . Our investigation could demonstrate an association between obesity and RTIs confirming previous findings on influenza - like illness [ 9 ] , bronchitis [ 18 ] and pneumonia [ 10 , 12 ] . We also saw an association between obesity and rhinitis , sinusitis and pharyngitis / laryngitis . An elevated risk for sinusitis among obese was also reported in a populationbased cohort of Danish women [ 13 ] . None of the two Danish population - based studies [ 12 , 13 ] used ORs of monthly prevalence , but hazard ratios ( HRs ) , as they could identify events on a daily basis . The HR of 1 . 6 [ 12 ] for the association with RTIs and the HR of 1 . 48 [ 13 ] for the association with URTIs are , however , of similar magnitude to the risk estimates which we observed . Mechanistically , excess adiposity might weigh down host defence as several mouse as well as human studies have suggested [ 19 , 20 ] . The here observed associations were more prominent for LRTIs compared to URTIs , but evident for both , and more pronounced when considering long lasting or frequent RTIs compared to single symptoms . Based on the infection diary data , we generated a RTI diary score summing - up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month , per whole season or over the whole period of three years . Considering the upper ten percentile of the distribution of such scores as an outcome , associations were typically stronger than when considering single symptoms , and interactions were more pronounced . Moreover , the results of the seasonal score were very similar or even stronger than those of the three - years score , arguing for the adequacy to query six months infectious events in future studies to identify the infection - prone sub - group of the population . Lifestyle habits seem to contribute to an individual ' s risk for RTI . Among them , cigarette smoking has been reported as a major environmental risk factor for recurrent and severe RTIs [ 4 , 5 ] . Frequent contact to small children [ 21 , 22 ] , vitamin D deficiency [ 23 , 24 ] , and lack of physical activity [ 25 , 26 ] constitute other exposures associated with heightened RTI risks . Moreover , higher levels of education were associated with a lower risk of CAP [ 27 ] . Based on those previous findings we investigated their role as possible confounders . The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age , gender , educational status , contact to children , smoking status , sports activity and nutrition scores , suggesting that the association is not markedly confounded by the effects of these factors on both BMI and the risk of infections . Also additional adjustment by measured serum vitamin D in a subgroup for which measurements were available did not change the risk estimates considerably . This supports arguments that the observed associations between obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non - obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences . In addition , some chronic diseases , foremost asthma and COPD , are associated with both an increased risk of RTIs and obesity [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] . Considering these associations we investigated the effect of asthma , COPD and a comorbidity scoresummarizing the other chronic conditionson the relationship between obesity and individual RTIs and the RTI diary score . Adjusting for these conditions individually and even more so in a combined fashion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the association between obesity and considered RTI outcomes . Hence part of the association between infections and obesity might be explainable by associations of co - morbidities with both . We see a gender difference in the observed associations with more noticeable findings for women . A significantly increased risk for combined RTIs was also restricted to women in a Danish blood donor cohort [ 12 ] . Several lines of research support this notion : Szabova et al . and Ilavska et al . reported gender - dependent effects of obesity on the immune system [ 33 , 34 ] . The effect of BMI on a variety of immune parameters including those with relevance for immune defence was much more apparent in women than in men [ 34 ] . NK cells ( CD3 - / CD16 + / CD56 + ) , represent first - line cells for the clearing of virus - infected cells . Reduced levels of these cells reported for obese women , but not for respective men , might underlie the gender effect seen in our study . We also investigated a potential effect modification by sports activity and nutrition . Interestingly , an association between obesity and RTIs was evident only for those obese individuals who reported a higher level of sports activity . Thus , only the group of obese people who engaged in more intensive sports activity reported RTIs more frequently whereas obese people with low sports activity and non - obese with low or high sports activity showed comparable lower prevalences for most outcomes . We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity , but not in normal weight individuals . Evidence supporting this has been previously published [ 35 ] . An imbalanced oxidative stress status may have negative consequences on mounting an appropriate immune response towards respiratory pathogens . Excessive reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) was shown to hinder T cell responses to viral infection [ 36 ] and ROS accumulation was detected in autophagy - deficient effector T cells rendering them incapable of controlling viral infections [ 37 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
