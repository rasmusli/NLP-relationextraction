Bats can also harbor protozoa and bacteria of potential zoonotic relevance [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Bartonella spp . are of particular interest , as these Gram - negative bacteria cause bacteremia and endocarditis in both humans and livestock [ 10 , 11 ] and exhibit high genetic diversity in bats across multiple continents and species [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] . Moreover , phylogenetic analyses show bats are reservoirs of zoonotic Candidatus B . mayotimonensis [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] , a causative agent of human endocarditis [ 21 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
