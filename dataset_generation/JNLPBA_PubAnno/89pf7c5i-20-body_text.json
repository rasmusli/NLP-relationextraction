The epidemiological role of cats in the maintenance and transmission of L . infantum should nevertheless be further investigated [ 43 ] . Questions that need to be addressed include : 1 ) are cats involved in the transmission of parasite by sand fly vectors in endemic areas where both infected cats and dogs are present ? 2 ) how attractive are cats to vector sandflies ? 3 ) how accessible is the parasite in infected cats to sand flies ?", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
