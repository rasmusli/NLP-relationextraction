The most affected countries typically had poor health infrastructure ( Arima and Shimada 2014 ; Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; McNamara 2016 ; Maras and Miranda 2016 ) . It is only during the most recent outbreak that the virus spread to high - income countries ( Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; Stanturf et al . 2015 ) . Within these countries , and as was exemplified in Liberia , the outbreak mostly affected those populations that were very poor , remote , and lacked proper physical infrastructure , including roads , proper sanitation , and health facilities .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
