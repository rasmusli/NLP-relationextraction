The lack of a relevant animal model has hampered the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches . Previously , We had developed and demonstrated that challenge of newborn hSCARB2 - transgenic mice with B genotypes of EV71 isolates , the early syndrome of HFMD , followed by progressively neurological LP were developed . In addition , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice elicit more susceptibility than the reported newborn mouse models for C genotype of EV71 infection which resulted in lethal neurological diseases . Despite the muscle - tropic EV71 viremia in the reported model that differ from the CNS - tropism of EV71 infection in humans , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice were characterized as bi - pathological tropism in the CNS and peripheral sites [ 11 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
