They have been widely evaluated in clinical trials to treat bacterial infections in pigs as an alternative to antibiotics use [ 144 ] . Recently , it was reported that dietary supplementation with bacteriophages for the treatment of PWD caused by an ETEC : F4 strain in an experimental model , was effective in reducing rectal temperature , faecal consistency score , E . coli adhesion score in the ileum and caecum , and villous height / crypt depth ratio ( VH / CD ) in the duodenum and jejunum [ 145 ] . However , there are several disadvantages associated with the use of phage therapy in swine . Phages have a narrow spectrum of activity directed against a limited number of bacteria and the possible development of bacterial resistance against phages has to be considered [ 144 ] . To overcome the narrow spectrum of activity , some recent studies have reported beneficial effects of a bacteriophage cocktail used in the feed for weanling pigs . This combination resulted in enhanced growth performance and gut health of pigs , although the combination of phages with probiotics did not show any additional effect [ 109 ] . Some authors have considered that the development of phage - resistant bacteria could be positive for the host [ 146 ] . In fact , resistance to phages can reduce the fitness of the bacteria and could thereby impair their competitive capacity and consequently their ability to colonize the intestinal mucosa of the host [ 146 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
