{"cord_uid": "bcwcjf01", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3836733", "divid": "6", "text": "In 2009 , the number of rabid foxes in Humboldt County infected with the CA skunk variant increased 356 % from an average of 1 - 2 per year in the preceding 15 years to 7 in the latter months of 2008 to 38 in 2009 ( Annual Reports from California Department of Public Health , Veterinary Public Health Section ) . In 2009 , only 2 skunks were reported rabid in Humboldt County suggesting that rabies infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted from a typical pattern of spillover from skunks to foxes to one resulting from fox - to - fox transmission . The reported numbers underestimate the extent of the outbreak since additional foxes exhibiting unusual or aggressive behavior were euthanized but not tested ( S . Chandler , USDA , personal communication ) . This epizootic of rabies in Northern California raised concerns not only because the primary species involved was gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) and not striped skunks which are the terrestrial reservoir species in this region , but also because this led to a significant spike in attacks by rabid animals on humans and their pets [ 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
