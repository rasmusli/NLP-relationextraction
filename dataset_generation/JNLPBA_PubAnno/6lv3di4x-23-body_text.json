We also show how this infection may lead to subsequent infection of myeloid cells known to be present in the submucosa . Our data are of relevance to understanding the mechanism of direct transmission for JEV and potentially other flaviviruses . Although the present work does not provide final proof that the respiratory epithelium represents the port of entry and exit during direct transmission events of JEV , our results represent an important basis for further in vivo investigations to confirm the cellular tropism of JEV and the kinetics of events during infection of pigs via the respiratory tract .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
