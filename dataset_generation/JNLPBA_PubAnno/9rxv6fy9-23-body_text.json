The custom irradiation chamber simulated the transmission of aerosolized viruses produced via human coughing and breathing . The chamber operated at a relative humidity of 55 % which resulted in a particle size distribution of 87 % between 0 . 3 \u00b5m and 0 . 5 \u00b5m , 11 % between 0 . 5 \u00b5m and 0 . 7 \u00b5m , and 2 % > 0 . 7 \u00b5m . A comparison to published ranges of particle size distributions is shown in Table 1 . Aerosolized viruses were efficiently transmitted through the system as evidenced from the control ( zero exposure ) showing clear virus integration ( Fig . 1 , top left ) . , ( 1 ) where k is the UV inactivation rate constant or susceptibility factor ( cm 2 / mJ ) . The regression was performed with the intercept term set to zero , which represents the definition of 100 % relative survival at zero UV dose . Bootstrap 95 % confidence intervals for the parameter k were calculated using R 3 . 2 . 3 software 41 . The virus inactivation cross section , D 95 , which is the UV dose that inactivates 95 % of the exposed virus , was calculated as D 95 = \u2212 ln [ 1 \u2212 0 . 95 ] / k .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
