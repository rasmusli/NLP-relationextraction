In the lower source control scenario ( scenario 3 . 1 ) it was assumed a reduction of 80 % for radon , CO and SHS and 25 % reduction of PM 2 . 5 , VOC and dampness exposures . In the higher source control scenario ( scenario 3 . 2 ) a total control ( 100 % ) of radon , CO and SHS and 75 % reduction of PM 2 . 5 , VOC and dampness exposures were assumed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
