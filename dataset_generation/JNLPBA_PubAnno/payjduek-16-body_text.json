Human herpes virus 6 infection has been reported in an infant with a viral exanthem presenting with BCG reactivation [ 17 ] . In addition , various respiratory viruses including enterovirus , adenovirus , human rhinovirus and coronavirus have been isolated significantly more frequently in children with KD than in controls [ 18 ] , although no direct association with BCG reactivation have been documented . As viral co - infections have been identified in children with measles [ 19 ] , a more extensive virology work - up may have been warranted in our patient when the unusual finding of BCG reactivation was discovered .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
