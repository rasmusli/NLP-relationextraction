HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the recombinant plasmid pFUGW - eEF1A or the empty vector pFUGW , and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 ( Addgene ) and pMD2 . G ( Addgene ) . At 6 hpt , the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5 % FBS . After 48 - h incubation , the supernatant of the cell culture was harvested and ultra - centrifuged to concentrate the recombinant lentiviruses . Subsequently , PK - 15 cells grown on 6 - well plates were transduced with the lentiviruses of 10 transduction units ( TU ) per cell . The expression of EGFP - eEF1A in the transduced PK - 15 cells was examined by Western blotting using a rabbit anti - eEF1A MAb ( 1 : 2000 ) ( catalog no . ab157455 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 53}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 298}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 333}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 715}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 812}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
