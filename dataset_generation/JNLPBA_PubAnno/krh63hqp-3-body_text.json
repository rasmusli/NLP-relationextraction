During the 1917 - 1918 pandemic , approximately 40 % of the human population was infected , with a death rate above 2 % . It is estimated that this virus killed more people than died in the world war that was just then ending . Mortality rates have dramatically declined since then [ 2 ] , but the H1N1 flu has persisted . As a zoonotic pathogen , the influenza virus is able to infect multiple species . It is generally thought that aquatic waterfowl are a primary natural influenza reservoir [ 3 ] , where there are usually no clinical symptoms [ 4 ] , and where low level transmission probably perpetuates the viral pool [ 5 ] . All 14 influenza subtypes are maintained in waterfowl [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
