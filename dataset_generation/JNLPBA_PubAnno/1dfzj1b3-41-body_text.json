This method was followed by [ 43 ] that demonstrated the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus possessed the strongest activity , even comparable to that of \u03b1 - tocopherol . However , in the same work the authors also reported that at higher concentrations of thyme oil , such capacity decreased . Basil oil , that was considered a good antioxidant when the activity was measured through the conjugated diene assay , did not stand out in this test , in which was only considered as possessing moderate activity . Such results may reveal that basil is only able to prevent the primary oxidation of lipids .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
