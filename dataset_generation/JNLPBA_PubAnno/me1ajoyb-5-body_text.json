Only a few dozen species have been identified as susceptible hosts , and most hantaviruses are hosted by a single rodent species [ 11 ] . In each hantavirus / rodent reservoir relationship , infection results in two prominent features : no conspicuous pathology and persistent infection [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . The earliest report of experimental infection of a reservoir host with its hantavirus was by Lee et al . [ 15 ] that described infection of striped field mice ( Apodemus agrarius ) with Hantaan virus . Inoculated mice developed chronic infection with transient viremia , and shed virus principally in urine , saliva and , to a lesser extent , feces , despite the production of neutralizing antibodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 778, "end": 802}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
