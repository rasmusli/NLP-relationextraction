Such an exercise reveals that for any observed k , the precise value of R 0 estimated is crucially dependent on the fundamental assumptions made concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods . Specifically , we find that the following equation determines the relationship between R 0 and an empirically estimated epidemic growth rate , k :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
