It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss in detail all the ideal conditions for pig housing during the post - weaning period , but to highlight the most important , as reviewed by Le Dividich and Herpin [ 39 ] , it is essential to provide the correct environmental temperature , 26 - 28 \u00b0 C , to maintain pigs in their thermo - neutral zone . Chilling reduces intestinal peristaltic activity and consequently increases bacterial colonization , and low temperatures in weaner facilities appears to be responsible for a more severe course of PWD [ 40 ] . Also , it has been shown that automatic temperature control in the weaners housing reduces considerably the prevalence of PWD [ 38 ] . Wathes and Whittemore [ 41 ] reviewed several recommendations to prevent pig diseases by appropriate housing and environmental management . These approaches involve avoiding drafts while removing moisture and gases using adequate ventilation . Most often , flat decks are used instead of soiled bedding for weaned piglets ; however it was reported that this practice is accompanied by more tail and belly lesions among pigs [ 42 ] . Moreover , the removal of manure and soiled bedding on a regular basis is also important to reduce the microbial load on farms .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
