{"cord_uid": "1bi6q127", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6410205", "divid": "17", "text": "To further bolster the claim of viral persistence in wild bats , a population level study was performed to understand the circulation of zoonotic viruses in bat populations and the involved immune mechanisms ( maternal antibody and acquired immune response ) using mathematical modelling [ 45 ] . The study used sero - surveillance of an African henipavirus in straw - colored fruit bats ( Eidolon helvum ) . While repeated introduction of virus and birthing of pups might drive viral dynamics in a large panmictic population of bats , prolonged infectious periods or latent infection of bats are required to explain henipavirus persistence in small populations ( natural or colony of captive ) . They found that if repeated introduction of virus into small populations was the only mechanism , then acute infections would have to be ~ 40 days in duration . This estimate is considerably longer than the current estimates of the detectable infectious period for henipaviruses in fruit bats , which is approximately 7 days [ 46 ] . Therefore , prolonged or latent infection has to occur in some bats for describing persistence of henipavirus in small populations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
