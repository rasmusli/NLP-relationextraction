Preventive measures including personal and in - house hygiene and cleanliness , and proper ventilation may be adopted across the peak ARI season . Other preventive measures include avoiding crowded public places and making a habit of frequent hand washing etc . Our data demonstrate that the majority of 200 symptomatic specimens were collected between August and February corresponding to post - monsoon and winter . In this region , the temperature mostly remains low in these months and it is commonly known that respiratory illness incidence rate is higher in winter . Winter season has bad reputation not only for upper respiratory tract infections caused by a large number of viruses but also for lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia [ 17 , 18 ] . Our study demonstrates that the most predominantly detected viral pathogen HRV was circulated throughout the year without showing any clear seasonal distribution . On the other hand , the peak circulation of the second most prevalent viral pathogen RSV was seen in September . HMPV showed its seasonal peak in January . The findings regarding winter seasonality of viral pathogens are thus consistent with previous studies of respiratory viral pathogen detections in Bangladesh [ 10 , 19 ] . Similar to the majority of viral pathogens , the bacterial pathogens including S . pneumoniae and K . pneumoniae , showed their peak circulations in September . So , the vulnerable group of children of the country requires appropriate preventive measures against ARI across the post monsoon and winter . However , this was a one - year study and the time period is meager to substantiate any seasonality of the pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
