In tropical and subtropical areas , RSV infections have been reported to peak more often in relation to the wet season , but locations close to the equator show a less consistent pattern , some with almost continuous RSV activity and varying seasonal peaks [ 1 , 7 ] . Studies in the Indian subcontinent have reported RSV infections to peak both in the cold season [ 27 ] and in the rainy season [ 35 , 36 ] , as well as being detectable throughout the year [ 35 , 37 ] . We observed RSV epidemics both in winter and during the monsoon . The virus was isolated during a period of 6 to 7 months and the epidemic peaks were observed with intervals of 15 and 9 months , which is consistent with patterns described elsewhere [ 31 , 38 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
