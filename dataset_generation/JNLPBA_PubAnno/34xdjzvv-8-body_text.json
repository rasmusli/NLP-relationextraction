An isotype antibody was given at the same concentration ( 200 mg ) as control in this study ( Fig . 4 ) . It was found that the mice had a better survival rate correlating to a shorter time interval of N3 administration post EV71 infection ; mice were fully protected when given one dose of", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 510, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
