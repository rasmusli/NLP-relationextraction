Antibiotic resistance patterns for the next predominating ARI agent Streptococcus species ( n = 10 ) were also alarming because there was 30 % to 80 % resistance frequency for all antibiotics except ceftriaxone . For E . agglomerans , 3 out of 4 isolates showed resistance to antibiotics like azithromycin , ceftriaxone , cefixime , tobramycin , and ciprofloxacin , whereas 2 isolates showed resistance to gentamicin . Even the carbapenems - imipenem and meropenem appeared ineffective against one E . agglomerans isolate , which showed resistance to all antibiotics . Finally , at least 1 of 3 isolates of H . influenzae showed some degrees of resistance to the antibiotics tested for antibiogram study .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
