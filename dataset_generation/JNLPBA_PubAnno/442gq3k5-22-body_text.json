S . suis infection was independently associated with occupations related to pigs , exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries in the 2 weeks prior to infection , and eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to infection after multivariate analysis . These associations were found in comparisons of cases with the hospital control group as well as with the community control group . Breeding pigs at home , diabetes mellitus , alcoholism or exposure to pigs or pork without skin injuries were not associated with S . suis infection in multivariate analysis ( Table 6 ) . In a sensitivity analysis , which included only male cases and controls , exactly the same risk factors were significant with similar odds ratios as in the main analysis . Risk factors identified by multivariate analysis of male cases and controls from either control group included eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes ( OR 1 ' ' High risk ' ' dishes predominantly consisted of undercooked food ( Table 3 ) . Exposure to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries , eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes , or both , were reported in 72 / 101 S . suis cases ( 71 . 3 % ) , 91 / 303 hospital controls ( 30 % ) and 84 / 300 community controls ( 28 % ) . For 26 S . suis cases ( 25 . 7 % ) , compared to 52 hospital controls ( 17 . 2 % ) and 29 community controls ( 9 . 7 % ) , eating these ' ' high risk ' ' dishes was the only risk factor reported .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
