All procedures which involve animals performed at the Institute of Virology and Immunology ( IVI ) comply with the Animal Welfare Act ( TSchG SR 455 ) , the Animal Welfare Ordinance ( TSchV SR 455 . 1 ) , and the Animal Experimentation Ordinance ( TVV SR 455 . 163 ) of Switzerland . All studies were reviewed by the ethical committee for animal experiments of the canton of Bern , Switzerland , and approved by the cantonal veterinary authorities ( Amt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und Natur , Veterin\u00e4rdienst ) . Blood sampling was approved with license number BE88 / 14 . Nasal mucosa was obtained in the context of regular slaughter of pigs at the slaughterhouse of the IVI . The pigs were not slaughtered for the purpose of organ collection . Consent for collecting samples after slaughter was obtained from the animal facility manager of the IVI .

First , 600 l per well of basolateral supernatants from JEV - infected porcine NEC were harvested at 72 hpi and dispensed into 24 - well plates . Next , 10 6 monocytes were added into Transwell inserts with 3 - m - diameter pores ( Becton , Dickinson ) and placed in the wells filled with the porcine NEC culture - derived basolateral medium . After 3 h of incubation at 39 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 , basolateral medium was harvested and total monocytes were harvested and quantified . Monocyte phenotype was verified by immunolabeling with anti - porcine CD14 ( MIL2 ; Bio - Rad ) . Controls included ALI medium , medium collected from mock - treated porcine NEC , and porcine CCL2 ( 200 pg / ml in ALI medium ; Kingfisher Biotech , St . Paul , MN ) . For monocyte quantification by flow cytometry , CountBright absolute counting beads ( Thermo Fisher ) were used following the manufacturer ' s manual . Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward / side scatter plots , followed by exclusion of doublets .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1324, "end": 1330}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
