Most of the investigators explored both the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of PPMO and the best protection was usually achieved with pre - infection and post - infection PPMO treatments . PPMOs were shown to suppress viral replication , attenuate symptoms of disease in and / or increase survivorship of mice infected with WNV [ 67 ] , DENV [ 70 ] , MHV [ 63 ] , PV1 [ 75 ] , CVB3 [ 76 ] , VEEV [ 77 ] , EBOV [ 64 , 78 ] , RSV [ 79 ] , and FLUAV [ 82 , 83 ] . Some PPMOs demonstrated very profound and impressive antiviral effects . In particular , two 5 - \u03bcg pre - infection doses of ( RX 8 ) B - conjugated PMOs completely protected mice against lethal challenge with EBOV [ 64 , 78 ] . Mice treated with 200 - \u03bcg doses of a ( RXR ) 4 XB - conjugated PPMO given pre - and postinfection survived VEEV lethal infection [ 77 ] . The authors found that over the 28 - day period of monitoring , VEEV was undetectable in PPMO - treated mice brain , blood and peripheral tissues .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
