Detection of virus and absence of disease have led researchers to suggest that bats are likely the reservoirs of these viruses . Asymptomatic infections have been observed in bats for human pathogens such as henipaviruses ( Nipah and Hendra viruses ) , coronaviruses ( Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) ) , and filoviruses ( Marburg virus and ebolaviruses ) [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] . For a species to be a viral reservoir , the virus needs to persist in the population . Two probable ways in which this can happen are ( 1 ) virus infection and clearing from infected individuals is an ongoing process and introduction of na\u00efve individuals maintains the virus in the population and ( 2 ) individuals infected with the virus are able to maintain the virus in the form of a persistent infection . Although either or both of these possibilities may influence the bat - virus relationship , there is considerable evidence for the maintenance of some viruses in bat populations by continued , low - level persistence .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
