Fluctuation can also be found for case 2 after t > 40 s , which is not as fierce as that of case 1 . This fluctuation is because the number of the suspended aerosols is too small [ 22 ] . Hence Figure 2 also suggests that human movement may influence the number of the suspended aerosols as well as the deposition and removal of the aerosols . To demonstrate the effects of human movement on deposition and removal of the aerosols , Figure 3 shows the suspended fraction of all the aerosols for case 1 ~ 3 . This suspended fraction is the ratio of the number of the aerosols remained airborne to the total number of injected aerosols . As shown in Figure 3 , the suspended fractions of case 1 ~ 3 keep decreasing . For higher moving speed , the suspended fraction decreases more slowly . For case 1 , when t \u2265 27 . 2 s , the number of the aerosols remained airborne is less than 500 and the suspended fraction is less than 10 \u2212 3 . When t \u2265 39 . 6 s , the suspended fraction is less than 10 \u2212 4 . For case 2 , the number of the aerosols remained airborne is larger than 500 until t = 37 . 2 s and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 \u2212 4 even after 50 s after the injections . For case 3 , there are still more than 900 aerosols remained airborne after 50 s after the injections , and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 \u2212 3 . This result indicates that the turbulence effects , which are induced by the movement of the standing person , can significantly lower the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols and influence the fluctuation of the average positions of the suspended aerosols . In case 1 ~ 3 , more than 99 % of the aerosols are deposited in the cabin . So the movement of the standing person does not significantly change the total deposition fraction of the aerosols .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
