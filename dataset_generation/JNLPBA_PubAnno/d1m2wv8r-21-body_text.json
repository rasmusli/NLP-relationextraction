These proteins can be potential targets for controlling viral infection . Dynamic changes in the expressed proteins in cluster B were noted . They were initially down - regulated at 12 and 24 hpi , followed by a rapid return to near basal levels at 36 hpi and slight up - regulation at 48 and 60 hpi . Thus , 12 and 24 hpi were the best time points to study these proteins ( Fig . 4 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
