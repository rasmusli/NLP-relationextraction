To avoid including cases of undiagnosed tuberculosis and reactive airway disease , we did not include children that had been coughing for more than 14 days and we reassessed respiratory rate in wheezers after salbutamol administration before diagnosis of pneumonia [ 20 ] . The number of measles cases in Nepal has decreased dramatically since 2003 [ 63 ] . Measles vaccination is recommended at 9 months and the vaccine coverage among those that were 9 months or older in our study area was > 90 % ( unpublished data ) . Moreover , less than 1 % of our cases had a rash and all of these were above 1 year of age . Thus , we believe that our sample consisted of children with pneumonia , and not tuberculosis , bronchial asthma , or measles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
