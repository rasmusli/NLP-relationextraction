They contacted asymptomatic or symptomatic patients , and symptomatic patients wore surgical masks . After MERS - CoV had been confirmed in a patient , all staff were fully protected when in contact with the patient . The closest contact occurred when touching and holding patients during transport . One responder wearing full PPE had a mild fever ( 37 . 5 \u00b0 C ) after contact with a symptomatic patient who was later confirmed as infected . Since the response system had not expanded in the early days of the outbreak , she was not tested but was isolated with self - monitoring .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
