Except for Columbus , Model 1 achieved a specificity closer to the nominal value across all EDs ( Model 3 outperforms Model 1 in Columbus ) . Except in Chicago , Model 4 had the largest magnitude of bias . Figure 9 compares the receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curves for the four models across the five EDs using the linear filter ( Across all models , the sensitivity for the 1 - day filter was the lowest while the 7 - day and linear filters tended to have the highest sensitivity ) . To readily compare the models , we use one minus the nominal specificity on the x - axis . Except for Akron and Minneapolis / St . Paul , the random weekly and daily time series components in Model 1 yield higher sensitivities , compared to including a day - of - week covariate plus ARMA errors in Model 2 , and day - of - week covariate plus no ARMA errors in Model 3 . This is due to the insignificance of the day - ofweek fixed effect in Models 2 and 3 . In Akron , Model 3 has higher sensitivities than Model 1 , suggesting that the time series errors are less relevant in outbreak signature detection for the test data . In Minneapolis / St . Paul Models 1 , 2 , and 3 have equivalent sensitivities . Across all cities either Model 2 or Model 4 had the lowest sensivities , indicating that these models are less reliable for outbreak signature detection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
