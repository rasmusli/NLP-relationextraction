Poorly designed or overcrowded healthcare facilities play an important role in TB transmission and also increases the chances of cross - infection between patients and healthcare workers . HCWs are essential in the fight against TB infection and they should be protected . A good ventilated working environment should have natural , mechanical , and negative pressure ventilation to reduce the risk of spreading TB infection in the wards . Natural ventilation relies on open doors and windows to bring fresh air in the wards from outside , which dilutes the concentration of particles such as droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
