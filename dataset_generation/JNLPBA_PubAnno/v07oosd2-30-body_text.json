The most promising way to mitigate the development of colistin resistance is to reduce the use of antimicrobials at the farm level ( Table 2 ) . There are documented relationships between housing conditions and incidence of PWD in pig herds ; Madec et al . [ 30 ] claimed that prevention of PWD disorders could be based solely on the control of zootechnical conditions . Moreover , stocking density reduction could be considered as a paramount strategy to decrease occurrence of PWD as well as other diseases in pigs [ 91 ] . Thus , improvement of breeding conditions in pig farms is a crucial measure to reduce the susceptibility of animals to microbial infections and consequently to reduce the use of antimicrobials in pig production [ 28 ] . The management strategies around weaning should focus on measures that avoid any kind of stress for pigs . These measures include preventing the spread of infection , providing the pigs with good thermal comfort , giving them adapted feed and allowing access to this feed for all pigs . Considerable research has been performed into developing diets for weaners and there is now a range of high quality diets that are readily digested by the early - weaned pig [ 31 ] . The main purposes of these diets are to achieve A powerful oral immunogen The proposed immunization procedure required large quantities of F4 [ 8 ] Leads to a specific mucosal immune response Antigen degraded by the pH of the stomach and by digestive enzymes", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1427, "end": 1442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1609, "end": 1626}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
