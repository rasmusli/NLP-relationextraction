In addition , the NS5A protein can inhibit the IRES - mediated translation through binding to the IRES located in the 5 1 - UTR . A previous study showed that the NS5A - interacting cellular proteins were screened using Y2H analysis , and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription , protein degradation , protein folding and metabolism [ 26 ] . Recently , heat shock protein 70 has been identified to interact with the CSFV NS5A and enhance viral RNA replication [ 27 ] . In this study , eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication . eEF1A had not been identified in the previous study , probably due to the different cell types ( endothelial cells vs . primary macrophages ) used to construct the cDNA library [ 26 ] . We showed that NS5A and eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm . As NS5A is the component of the replication complex , whether eEF1A is also localized in the replication complex needs further investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
