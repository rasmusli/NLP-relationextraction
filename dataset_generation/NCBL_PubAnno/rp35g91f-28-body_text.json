Nostrin has been shown to be required for vascular development and angiogenesis by acting as a molecular conduit for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( FGFR1 ) - mediated induction of Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( RAC1 ) activity ( Kovacevic et al . 2012 ) . Interestingly , Nostrin has been shown in both mice ( Kim et al . 2005 ) and humans ( Wiesenthal et al . 2009 ) to bind to and negatively regulate transcription of its own promoter via a centrally located bZIP DNA binding motif ( Bae et al . 2014 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
