Control samples were transfected with EGFP expression plasmid ( pSGI - EGFP ) . Forty - eight hours post - transfection , cells were fixed in 1 % formaldehyde and ChIP assay was performed as described elsewhere [ 24 ] . Forward and reverse primer sequences for amplification of MHC - I heavy chain promoter were 5 0 CAGGGAGT CCAGTTCAGGGA 3 0 and 5 0 TGAGTCCGGGTGGGTGC GTG 3 0 , respectively and for amplification of IL - 8 promoter were 5 0 GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAA TC 3 0 and 5 0 TTCCT TCCGGTGGTTTCTTC 3 0 , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
