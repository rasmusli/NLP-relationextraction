Surprisingly limited data of measured ventilation rates are available for European countries . Due to this , available measured data was reviewed and a regression model was created combining the climatological and economical differences in the building stocks with ventilation rates . Further modelling with a Bayesian subjective probability approach was used for generation of lognormal probability distributions for ventilation rates in each EU - 26 country ( Table 1 , method described in detailed elsewhere [ 17 ] ) .
