They reported the distribution of the conjugates throughout the mouse major internal organs when administered by oral route as well as their slow release and clearance from different organs . Surprisingly , unconjugated naked PNA TAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile although the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate . In vi vo antiviral activity of PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
