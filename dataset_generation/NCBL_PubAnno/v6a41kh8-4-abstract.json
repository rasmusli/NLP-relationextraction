CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study . The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection , which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter . The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity ( r s = 0 . 40 , P = 0 . 01 ) , but not with temperature or rainfall . An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity ( r s = 0 . 55 , P = 0 . 0005 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 290}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 423}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 462}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 564, "end": 568}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 707}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 795}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
