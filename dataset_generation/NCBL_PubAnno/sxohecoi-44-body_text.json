Two anti - FcRn antibodies were used : 1 ) Anti - FcRn antibody purified from rabbit serum raised against a2 ( 88 - 177aa ) and a3 ( 1782 - 247aa ) domains of human FcRn ( provided by Neil Simister , Brandeis University ) for use on frozen sections ( Figure 5 ) , and 2 ) rabbit anti - FcRn antibody obtained from Novus Biologicals for use on paraffin sections following citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) antigen retrieval ( Figure S7 ) . Sections were blocked with serum - free protein solution , and optimally diluted primary FcRn antibodies or rabbit IgG ( negative control ) were added and incubated for 1 - 2 hours at RT . Binding of antibodies to FcRn in tissues was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase detection system that stains positive cells bright red . Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and cover - slipped using aqueous mounting medium .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
