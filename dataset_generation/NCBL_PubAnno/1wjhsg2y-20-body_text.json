Eidolon helvum , the second largest Old World fruit bat in Africa and potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses and other zoonotic pathogens [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] , is widespread and panmictic across sub - Saharan Africa but occurs in small areas of Yemen and southwestern Saudi Arabia [ 40 , 114 , 115 ] . Other bat species found within the region have been linked with viruses of concern to human health in at least part of their geographic range . Rhinolophus hipposideros , a species whose range extends from the United Kingdom , east to China and south to Ethiopia ( covering much of South , Central , and Western Asia ) [ 116 ] , has been found to harbor SARS - like CoVs . In Slovenia , for example , nearly 40 % of fecal samples collected from R . hipposideros tested positive for SARS - like CoVs , in particular the bat - associated SARS isolate Rp3 / 2004 [ 117 ] . There is also evidence that through cross - species viral sharing , R . hipposideros contributed to a recombinant CoV strain thought to have ancestral linkages to HCoV - NL63 [ 118 ] , a human - CoV that can account for up to 10 % of respiratory infections annually [ 119 ] . Given the paucity of research on bat - associated viruses to date and the extensive species overlap from diverse biogeographic regions , Western Asia presents an untapped opportunity to further investigate the factors that determine cross - species viral transmission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 234}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1243, "end": 1266}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
