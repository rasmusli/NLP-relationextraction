This is particularly true for PPMO research where much effort has been put towards developing highly active peptides to outperform the more traditionally used penetratin and tat peptides [ 61 , 62 ] . Improving CPP endosomolytical properties to intensify antiviral activity of the conjugated cargo has become a main focus , as the endosomal escape appears to be critical to antiviral activity [ 30 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
