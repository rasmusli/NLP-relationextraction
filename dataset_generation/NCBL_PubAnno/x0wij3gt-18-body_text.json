Then we explored the role of c - Jun in mediating PGE 2induced PDK1 expression in normal bronchial epithelial cells . PGE 2 induces the expression of c - Jun protein in a time - dependent and dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 3a ) . C - Jun reached its peaks at 2 h in BEAS2B cells and 4 h in HBEc14 - KT cells with the concentration of 1 \u03bcM of dmPGE 2 , compared to the control group ( 2 . 561 \u00b1 0 . 189 vs 1 . 000 \u00b1 0 . 063 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 01 ; 1 . 347 \u00b1 0 . 132 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 01 ) . c - Jun reached its peak with the concentration of 1 \u03bcM of dmPGE 2 after incubation for 4 h , compared to the control group ( 1 . 499 \u00b1 0 . 108 vs 1 . 001 \u00b1 0 . 063 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 01 ; 1 . 536 \u00b1 0 . 174 vs 1 . 000 \u00b1 0 . 024 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 01 ) . Silencing of c - Jun with its siRNA decreases cell proliferation ( 1 . 115 \u00b1 0 . 054 vs 1 . 386 \u00b1 0 . 072 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 05 ; 1 . 030 \u00b1 0 . 104 vs 1 . 495 \u00b1 0 . 072 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3b ) and ( See figure on previous page . ) Fig . 1 The effect of dmPGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and induction of expression and activation of PDK1 . a Effects on cell proliferation . b dmPGE 2 increases the phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 in a time - and dose - dependent manner in BEAS2B and HBEc14 - KT cells . c PDK1 inhibitor OSU - 03012 decreases cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells . d PDK1 siRNA decreases the cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells . e PDK1 plasmid increases the cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells . f Effect on mRNA expression . g Effect on PDK1 promoter activity the expression of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 ( 1 . 105 \u00b1 0 . 011 vs 2 . 534 \u00b1 0 . 029 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 01 ; 1 . 157 \u00b1 0 . 021 vs 1 . 892 \u00b1 0 . 027 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 01 ) induced by dmPGE 2 ( Fig . 3d ) .
