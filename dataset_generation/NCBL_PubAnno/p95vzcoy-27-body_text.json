Since ants are ubiquitous and important in terrestrial ecosystems , it appears as if there is a considerable potential for virus transmission between wild insects and managed bees with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning . It has been suggested that viruses might offer novel options for the control of invasive ant species [ 37 ] . However , we consider such biocontrol suboptimal due to the evident wide host range of viruses and the here demonstrated considerable chances of host - switches , with possibly dramatic consequences [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 86}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
