During the 2001 outbreak of foot - and - mouth disease in the United Kingdom , for example , the former UK Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries , and Food set up a committee that included two groups with expertise in mathematical modeling of disease dynamics . It is becoming increasingly important , therefore , that epidemiological models produce accurate quantitative predictions , and this in turn relies on accurate parameterization . Here , we examine the dynamical consequences of an unrealistic yet almost ubiquitous assumption embedded in such models concerning the distribution of the latent and infectious periods . In particular , we show that without greater care in model formulation , we may risk systematic biases when parameterizing models from data and may make overly optimistic policy recommendations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 472}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
