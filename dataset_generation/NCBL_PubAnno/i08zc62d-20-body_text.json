We also found that diplacone is the most effective inhibitor among these flavonoids . This inhibitor also shows a time - dependent competitive inhibition pattern . The crystal structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic domain in complex with diplacone rationalized how the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl groups of diplacone contribute to the stability of the enzyme - inhibitor complex ( Table 2 ) . From the structural information described above , we suggest further modification strategies of diplacone to improve its inhibitory properties against C . perfringens NanI . In the Cp - NanI - diplacone complex , two water molecules ( W1 and W2 ) mediate hydrogen bonds between Cp - NanI residues ( Arg285 and Asp328 with W1 and Gln493 , Thr538 and Tyr587 with W2 ) of the catalytic site and diplacone atoms ( O1 with W1 and C4 with W2 ) ( Table 2 and Fig . 2b ) . Introducing polar moieties such as carboxylic and amino groups at the O1 or C4 positions of diplacone may possibly improve binding affinity in the Cp - NanI catalytic site through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds . Addition of hydrophobic groups , including phenyl , benzyl and cyclohexyl groups , to C3 of diplacone may also increase the binding affinity via hydrophobic contact with the hydrophobic patch ( Phe353 , Trp354 and Phe460 ) of the enzyme . Furthermore , aryl groups ( phenyl or benzyl ) may form a potential dipole - dipole interaction with Phe353 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
