The three vertically stacked lamps produced a nearly uniform dose distribution along the vertical axis thus every particle passing horizontally through the irradiation chamber received an identical dose . The lamp width ( 100 mm ) was smaller than the width of the irradiation chamber window ( 260 mm ) so the lamp power was higher near the center of the irradiation chamber window compared to the edge . The UV sensitive film indicated a power of approximately 120 \u00b5W / cm 2 in the center third of the window and 70 \u00b5W / cm 2 for the outer thirds . The silicon detector was used to quantify the reflectivity of the aluminum sheet at approximately 15 % of the incident power . Combining this data allowed the calculation of the average total dose of 2 . 0 mJ / cm 2 to a particle traversing the window in 20 seconds . Additionally , the silicon detector was used to confirm the attenuation of 222 - nm light through a single sheet of plastic film was 65 % . The addition of one or two sheets of plastic film between the lamps and the irradiation chamber window yielded average doses of 1 . 3 mJ / cm 2 and 0 . 8 mJ / cm 2 , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
