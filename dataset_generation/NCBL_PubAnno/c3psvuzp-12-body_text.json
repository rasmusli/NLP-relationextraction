This protein segment is completely encoded by the largest exon of PARP4 ( exon 30 in humans ) . To illustrate the unusual selective pressures on exon 30 , we performed a pairwise dN / dS comparison of human and rhesus PARP4s . We found that whereas the overall dN / dS ratio over PARP4 is 0 . 63 , the dN / dS ratio for exon 30 alone is 1 . 75 ( . 95 % confidence for dN / dS . 1 ) ( Table S3 ) . This striking discrepancy between the evolution of exon 30 and the rest of the protein raised the possibility that this exon alone was responsible for the signature of positive selection in PARP4 . We therefore repeated our positive selection analyses with exon 30 alone and found a robust signature of positive selection . In contrast , the remainder of PARP4 showed no signature of positive selection upon removal of exon 30 ( Figure 2B ) . Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility of weak selection acting outside exon 30 in PARP4 , our analysis strongly suggests that exon 30 of PARP4 has uniquely evolved under strong recurrent positive selection in primates . Because this evolutionary signature is isolated to a single exon , we next asked whether exon 30 is ever excluded from the PARP4 transcript . We searched human and rhesus expressed sequence tag ( EST ) databases and found that all isoforms of PARP4 include exon 30 , suggesting that exon 30 is important for PARP4 function . Next , we searched the region encoded by exon 30 for sequence or structural homology to other protein domains . Surprisingly , secondary structure prediction software ( JPRED [ 46 ] ) indicated that the region encoded by exon 30 in human PARP4 is almost entirely disordered . Taken together , we conclude that PARP4 has evolved under recurrent positive selection in primates , but that positive selection is focused on the disordered region encoded by exon 30 alone .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
