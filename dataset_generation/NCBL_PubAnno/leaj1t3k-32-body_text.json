To our knowledge , the first report of the successful use of CPP to deliver potential antiviral agents into cells is by Vocero - Akbani et al . in 1999 [ 103 ] . In their elegant study , the authors took a novel approach to specifically kill HIV - infected cells thereby preventing the production of infectious virions . They engineered a zymogen form of the apoptosis - promoting enzyme caspase 3 that , upon entry into HIV - infected cells , would be processed into its active form by the HIV protease ( Figure 1 ) . To deliver this modified caspase - 3 into Jurkat T cells , they armed the recombinant protein with the tat peptide at its N - terminal . The authors showed that they could transduce about 100 % of cells in less than 20 min . Confocal analysis localized FITC - labeled TAT - caspase - 3 to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments . While TAT - caspase - 3 remained inactive in uninfected cells , its uptake resulted in massive apoptosis in HIV - infected Jurkat T cells . Although a very promising study , no further or follow - up investigations have been reported .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 582}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1121}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
