Several studies reported that specific chicken antibodies provide protection against ETEC infections in pigs [ 111 ] . Despite the effectiveness of this practice , we have not found in the recent literature ( last 5 years ) any studies evaluating the use of specific egg yolk antibodies in PWD control . This is probably the consequence of the non - profitability in pig production of this practice , or the lack of protection against ETEC challenge or PWD occurrence , possibly because the antibodies contained in the eggs are not specific against the infected ETEC strains present on the farm [ 143 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 234}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 427}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 573}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 590}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
