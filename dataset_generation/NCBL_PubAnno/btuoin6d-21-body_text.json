The change in antibiotics treatment regimen was more frequent in the Adv group patients than in the Non - Adv patients ( 70 . 1 % vs . 27 . 2 % , P = 0 . 024 ) . The duration of antibiotic treatment was not significantly different between the two groups . In our study , we did not evaluate the administration of cidofovir or adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . In addition , there were no patients who received mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support . At admission , the mean dose of antipyretics administered was higher in the Adv group patients than in the Non - Adv group patients ( 5 . 52 vs . 4 . 30 g , P = 0 . 032 ) , although the overall duration of antipyretics was not significantly different between the two groups . In this study , we identified adverse events after antipyretics administration , such as hypotension , gastrointestinal trouble , skin rash , and elevated liver enzyme , which were commonly observed in the Adv group patients ( P = 0 . 005 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1127, "end": 1139}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1141, "end": 1166}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1168, "end": 1178}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
