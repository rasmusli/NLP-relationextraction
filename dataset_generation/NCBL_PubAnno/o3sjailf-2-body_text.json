We developed a NGS - based pipeline ( ezVIR ) to process NGS data for the identification of viruses in humans 2 with the aim of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses in biological specimens of subjects with unexplained clinical syndromes . 2 , 3 We used ezVIR to analyze 30 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in a previous study that examined the causes of fever in Tanzanian children 4 who were suffering from respiratory symptoms of any type but for whom an infectious agent was not detected ( except colonizing bacteria in the nasopharynx ) despite extensive investigations , including viral , bacterial and parasitic molecular and serological assays . 4 The specimens were pooled in groups of five and assessed according to the specific RNA and DNA library preparation protocols as previously described 2 for NGS analysis ( paired - end sequencing using the 100 - bp protocol with indexing on a HiSeq 2500 ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Unexpectedly , an astrovirus VA1 was identified in pool 1 ( Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 756}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 825}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
