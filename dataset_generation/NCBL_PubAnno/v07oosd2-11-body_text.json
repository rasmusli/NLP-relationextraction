Madec et al . [ 30 ] reported that the low feed intake over the first week after weaning is strongly correlated with the risk of disease occurrence over the post - weaning period . Underfeeding during weaning reduces growth performance of pigs , and contributes to intestinal inflammation and adversely affects villous height and crypt depth [ 3 ] . This morphological disruption of the intestinal mucosa promotes the creation of an ideal environment for the multiplication of bacteria such as E . coli and allows toxins and bacteria to cross the epithelium as a result of this inflammation [ 37 ] ( Fig . 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 495}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
