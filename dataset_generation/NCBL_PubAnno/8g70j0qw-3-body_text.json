Notably , in the largest study that assessed severity , there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support , mechanical ventilation or who had died , and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases 12 . However , from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1 . 4 times more likely ( RR = 1 . 4 , 95 % CI : 0 . 98 - 2 . 00 ) to have severe symptoms of COVID - 19 and approximately 2 . 4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU , need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non - smokers ( RR = 2 . 4 , 95 % CI : 1 . 43 - 4 . 04 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 105}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 537, "end": 548}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
