While IPknot is faster than Iterative HFold and uses less memory , we found that for the HK - PK and IP - pk168 data sets , Iterative HFold provides significantly more accurate predictions of pseudoknotted structures , compared with IPknot . Based on our results on the HK - PK data set , Iterative HFold ' s performance with more than 5 % information about the true pseudoknot - free structure , is better than that of IPknot with default settings ( data shown in Additional file 3 ) . We note that Sato et al . [ 42 ] find the performance of IPknot with predictions using \" NUPACK \" superior to all versions of IPknot , but since this model can be used for RNA sequences of length < 80 nucleotides , we did not compare our results with this version of IPknot . Among all different versions of IPknot we tested , we found all but \u03b3 1 = 1 and \u03b3 2 = 1 setting producing similar confidence intervals for all but the HK - PK - free data sets , for which \u03b3 1 = 4 and \u03b3 2 = 8 produces the best result ( data shown in Additional file 2 ) . While running parameter refinement with one iteration improved the confidence intervals in the HK - PK data set , it did not result in any improvement in accuracy in the rest of our data sets as in many cases IPknot failed to produce results . We note that our results on the IP - pk168 data set with different weight parameters perfectly match the results of Sato et al . [ 42 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
