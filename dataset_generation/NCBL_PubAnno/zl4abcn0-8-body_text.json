Likewise , there is no report on the capability of callus culture of H . littoralis to produce secondary metabolites such as lycorine which has important pharmacological effects . The establishment and quantification of lycorine via in vitro propagation technique could be a first step in mass production of any desired secondary metabolites in pharmaceutical industries . Thus , in the present study , a simple HPLC with UV detection method was developed for phytochemical analysis of different parts of H . littoralis wild plants . The method was further extended for the quantification of lycorine in callus culture obtained from various combinations of 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4 - D ) and 6 - benzylaminopurine concentrations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
