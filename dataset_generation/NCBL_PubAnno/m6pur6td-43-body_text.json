Quantitative analyses and time - series analysis were performed on the influencing mechanism for various influencing factors both at the industrial sector and the residential sector for the three different development periods , namely , the 10 th five - year plan period ( 2003 ) ( 2004 ) ( 2005 ) , the 11 th five - year plan period ( 2005 - 2010 ) , and the 12 th five - year plan period ( 2010 - 2013 ) . The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods . Overall , the affluence effect ( g - effect ) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase , while the energy intensity effect of production ( e - effect - Production ) , the economic structure effect ( s - effect ) and the carbon intensity effect of production ( f - effect - Production ) were the main contributing factors suppressing the carbon emission growth at the industrial sector . Considering the high urbanization level in Guangzhou , the affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) was the most dominant positive driving factor on the carbon emissions increment , while the energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth at the residential sector .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
