We have also shown that FcRn is present on epithelial cells in areas of the genital tract that are potentially exposed to HIV - 1 during sexual intercourse . Our findings point toward a novel mechanism by which the sexual transmission of HIV - 1 may be facilitated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
