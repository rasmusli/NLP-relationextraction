By default , output includes ID - to - name log in which selected information about generated names is detailed in table format that can be downloaded as an Excel file . This table can be useful for controlling the name generation procedure and preparing legends to accompany an alignment or a phylogenetic tree in publication . The user can also extract IDs from submitted alignment or tree by activating \" names only \" option , or retrieve annotation from cognate entries in table format . In the current implementation of SNAD , the most time - consuming stage is data retrieval from databases . For large queries and complex name formats , also using API , it is therefore advisable to start with less than 10 sequences to design a format to be used for the full query . Queries containing up to 500 IDs and including sequence alignments up to 50000 characters can be processed through SNAD web page . For queries containing more than 500 IDs , the user is advised to use one of the SNAD APIs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
