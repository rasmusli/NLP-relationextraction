Consequently , bacteria can more easily enter the lungs to cause pneumonia [ 75 ] . Many of the virus - bacteria interaction mechanisms involve viral compromise of the innate immune system . These include impairment and depletion of resident alveolar macrophages [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] and neutrophils , which are necessary for bacterial clearance , mediated by induction of type I interferons [ 104 ] and desensitization to Toll - like receptor ligands [ 105 ] . Detailed descriptions of potential biological pathways involved in these mechanisms are discussed in earlier reviews by Robinson et al . [ 55 ] and McCullers [ 9 ] . Finally , excessive inflammation in the lungs due to virus - initiated exacerbation of inflammatory mediators , cytokines and chemokines , can cause tissue damage [ 6 ] , which increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 28}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 211}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
