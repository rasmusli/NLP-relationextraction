Although the outcome variable of interest is counts , like other researchers in the field [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] , we model the data using a Gaussian rather than Poisson process . The reasons are : ( i ) A normal approximation to the Poisson random variable is reasonable when the mean number of radiograph counts is large , as in this study ; ( ii ) Gaussian time series models are easier to fit , diagnose , and interpret ; ( iii ) The theory for filter - based methods commonly used for detecting the outbreak signature in such data is well developed for Gaussian processes . In some applications , count data are transformed when Gaussian models are used . Transformations , such as log or square root , are used to parameterize multiplicative models or to stabilize the variance . We use the original scale instead of transforming the data , like other researchers in the area , for ease of interpretation . This is especially important when we analyze filter - based detection methods in this article . For the same reason , we do not model the number of chest radiographs per daily ED visits ( i . e . , the proportion of radiographs ) . The filter - based theory , allows us to directly assess the effect of additive stochastic outbreaks signatures upon the radiograph series .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
