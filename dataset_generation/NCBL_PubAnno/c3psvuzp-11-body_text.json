Vaults are barrel - shaped particles composed of three proteins , MVP ( major vault protein ) , PARP4 , and TEP1 ( telomerase associated protein ) , as well as vRNA ( vault RNA ) [ 44 ] . The function of vaults is unknown , but they have been implicated in drug resistance , cancer and immunity . In support of a role in immunity , MVP , the core structural component of the . 10 mDa mass of vaults , is upregulated by IFN , and vaults are most highly expressed in immune cell types such as dendritic cells and macrophages [ 45 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 556}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
