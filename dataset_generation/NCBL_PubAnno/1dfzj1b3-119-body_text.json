The search for antiinflammatory activities in essential oils has also increased during these last years . This work reports the antioxidant activities of essential oils which may act by preventing lipid peroxidation , scavenging free radicals or , and in very few cases , chelating metal ions . Some works also showed that the constituents of essential oil act synergistically because their main components when used as references have less activity than the essential oil . Therefore , synergism and antagonism studies must be developed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
