Subsequently , the plasmids were linearized by EcoRV and transcribed in vitro using a RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system ( catalog no . P1300 ; Promega ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The resulting RNA was labeled with photobiotin ( catalog no . A14216 ; Baoman , Shanghai , China ) using a mercury vapor lamp for 30 min . HEK293T cells grown on 6 - well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids ( pMyc - NS5A and pMyc - eEF1A ) and lyzed with the lysis buffer . The lysate collected from two wells of the 6 - well plate ( lyzed with 150 \u00b5L of lysis buffer per well ) was incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA ( 2 \u00b5g ) for 4 h at 4 [UNK] C , and then incubated with streptavidin beads ( catalog no . 11205D ; Invitrogen ) for another 30 min at room temperature . The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti - Myc MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) . For competitive RNA pulldown , the cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of unlabeled IRES RNA ( 0 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 5 and 3 \u00b5g ) for 1 h at 4 [UNK] C and then incubated with the biotinylated IRES and streptavidin beads . The experiments were carried out in triplicates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
