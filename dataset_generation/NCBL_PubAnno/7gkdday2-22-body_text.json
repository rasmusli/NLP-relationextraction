It should be mentioned here that two isolates of S . pneumoniae from asymptomatic ARI participants showed an antibiotic sensitivity pattern similar to that of S . pneumoniae isolates from symptomatic children ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 459, "end": 463}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
