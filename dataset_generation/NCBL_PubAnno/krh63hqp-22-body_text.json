The mutation count trajectory of the H1N1 lineage The data in Figure 3 can be used to estimate the time of arrival into the human population of the first H1N1 virus . Extrapolating total mutation count linearly backwards to zero yields a year of first introduction into the human population of approximately 1893 . Interestingly , this would be in time to explain the 1889 - 1890 \" Russian \" flu outbreak , which has been considered by some to possibly be the first H1N1 outbreak ( no sequence or serotype data are available for that event ) . While our data strongly suggest that the ancestral genotype for all human and porcine H1N1 influenza strains ( and by extension , all human influenza strains ) , entered the human population as early as the 1890s , others have estimated the arrival date to be one or more decades later [ 5 ] . Our data strongly confirm that all human H1N1 viruses derive from a single , very recent common ancestor , just as others have concluded prior to this study [ 1 ] . Given an estimated arrival date of 1893 , we infer that , by 1918 , H1N1 would have accumulated roughly 375 ( 25 years \u00d7 15 mutations / year ) mutations since the initial genotype invaded the human population . This depends , of course , on the exact arrival date .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 751, "end": 766}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
