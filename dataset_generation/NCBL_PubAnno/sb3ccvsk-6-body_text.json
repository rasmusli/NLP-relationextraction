CLN were dissociated through a cell strainer and single cell suspensions washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium . For splenocyte isolation , tissues were dissociated , treated with Gey ' s solution to lyse red blood cells , and washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium . To isolate CNS infiltrating cells , brains and spinal cords were homogenized in 4 - ml Dulbecco ' s PBS using TenBroeck tissue grinders as described ( 26 ) . Tissue homogenates were adjusted to 30 % Percoll ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) and underlayed with 1 - ml 70 % Percoll . Following centrifugation at 850 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0 C , mononuclear cells were recovered from the 30 - 70 % interface and washed with RPMI 1640 medium .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
