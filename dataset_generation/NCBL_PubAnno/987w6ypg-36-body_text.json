The following DNA expression constructs have been described before : Gag - Pol + non - structural proteins and corresponding viral genomes coding GFP that yield single - cycle infection - competent viruses derived from different retroviruses [ 38 ] ; replicationcompetent HIV - 1 proviral clones ( X4 - or R5 - tropic , NL4 - 3 and ADA , respectively ) ; VSVg and HIV - 1 envelopes ; the Vpr - Blam and Gag - GFP [ 32 , 44 ] ; GALV and RD - TR [ 29 ] . For WB and immuno - gold analyses , the following antibodies were used : anti - Tubulin ( Sigma ) , anti - Flag ( F7425 , Sigma ) , anti - Gag / p24 ( clone 183 - H5C from the AIDS Reagents Program of the NIH ) , anti - Env ( for WB : # ab21179 , Abcam ) , anti - IFITM1 , \u2212 2 and \u2212 3 ( # 60074 - 1 - Ig , 12769 - 1 - AP and 11714 - 1 - AP , respectively , Proteintech ) , anti - CD45 ( Becton Dickinson ) . IFN\u03b1 ( Eurobio ) was used at a final concentration of 1 , 000 U / mL .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
