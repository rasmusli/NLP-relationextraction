A one - pass , dynamic aerosol / virus irradiation chamber was constructed in a similar configuration to that used by Ko et al . 33 , Lai et al . 34 , and McDevitt et al . 19 , 35 . A schematic overview of the system is shown in Fig . 3 and is pictured in Fig . 4 . Aerosolized viruses were generated by adding a virus solution into a high - output extended aerosol respiratory therapy ( HEART ) nebulizer ( Westmed , Tucson , AZ ) and operated using a dual - head pump ( Thermo Fisher 420 - 2901 - 00FK , Waltham , MA ) with an input flow rate of 11 L / min . The aerosolized virus flowed into the irradiation chamber where it was mixed with independently controlled inputs of humidified and dried air . Humidified air was produced by bubbling air through water , while dry air was provided by passing air through a desiccant air dryer ( X06 - 02 - 00 , Wilkerson Corp , Richland , MI ) . Adjusting the ratio of humid and dry air enabled control of the relative humidity ( RH ) within the irradiation chamber which , along with the nebulizer settings , determined the aerosol particle size distribution . An optimal RH value of 55 % resulted in a distribution of aerosol particle sizes similar to the natural distribution from human coughing and breathing , which has been shown to be distributed around approximately 1 \u00b5m , with a significant tail of particles less than 1 \u00b5m 36 - 38 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
