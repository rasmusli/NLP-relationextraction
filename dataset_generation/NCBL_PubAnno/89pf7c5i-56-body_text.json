These low molecular mass antigens are considered to be also the most specific polypeptides in the diagnosis of human [ 84 , 85 ] and CanL [ 86 , 87 ] . It is important to highlight that cats from both endemic and non endemic areas may be positive against high molecular weight antigens . This is also observed in dogs and humans and it is considered as a cross - reaction probably due to the presence of antibodies to the heat shock protein 70 family [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 22}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
