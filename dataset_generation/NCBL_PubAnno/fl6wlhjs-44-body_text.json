Namely , the filtered signals increase over the first week , and then slowly decrease . The spikes in the distributions of the original signal are preserved for the 1 - day filter , smoothed out for the 7 - day filter , and partial smoothed over for the linear and exponential filters . Smoothing out the spikes tends to lead more sustained peaks ( i . e . , wider periods of higher sensitivity ) . The power of detection is smaller for the 1 - day and 7 - day than the linear and the exponential ( as witnessed by smaller maximum heights in each of these stwo curves ) . For all filters , a drop below zero occurs immediately after the peaks ; the counts go slowly back to zero . Periods for which the filtered signals are below zero inhibit detection and thus can mislead the prediction of the end of the outbreak signature .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
