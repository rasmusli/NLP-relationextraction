Most assays that assess CTL functions require susceptible syngeneic target cells , which have been difficult to obtain with reservoir hosts . Susceptible primary cell lines from reservoir hosts have been produced [ 37 , 78 ] , but these are typically obtained from embryonic fibroblasts , thus matching of MHC alleles for use in CTL assays is difficult .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
