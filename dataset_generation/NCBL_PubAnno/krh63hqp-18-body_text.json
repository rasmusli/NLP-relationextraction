{"cord_uid": "krh63hqp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3507676", "divid": "18", "text": "The linear accumulation of mutations during the 2009 outbreak clearly also extends to the longer - term accumulation of mutations during the entire history of H1N1 ( Figure 2 ) . During the last century there has been a remarkably constant increase in mutation count within the H1N1 virus population , except for a striking discontinuity between 1957 and 1976 . This discontinuity reflects the extinction of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s , followed by the re - introduction of the strain in 1976 , presumably from a researcher ' s freezer . Even though most reports ( e . g . , [ 53 ] ) indicate the re - introduction year was 1977 , our data suggests the year of re - introduction was 1976 . This is based upon the isolate A / New Jersey / 1976 , which very clearly falls in line with the rest of the re - introduced lineage . Notice that after re - introduction in 1976 , the human H1N1 mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the extinction occurred in the 1950s .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
