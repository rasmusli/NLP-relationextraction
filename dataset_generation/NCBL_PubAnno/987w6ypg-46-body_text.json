Expression of IFITMs does not grossly affects viral production and does not modify the Env to Gag ratio of viral particles . A ) The overall amount of viral particles produced upon co - transfection of HEK293T cells with DNAs coding HIV - 1 vectors and IFITMs was quantified by exo - RT activity . B ) The amount of Env and of CA present in exo - RT normalized viruses obtained in the presence or absence of IFITMs was determined by ELISA and is presented here as a gp120 / p24 ratio . The graphs present averages and SEM obtained with 3 to 8 independent experiments . * p \u2264 0 , 05 , according to a Student t test .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
