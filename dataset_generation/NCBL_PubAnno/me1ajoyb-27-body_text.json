Identification of cell surface markers could shed light on what cells respond during hantavirus infection of reservoir hosts . While cell surface antigens tend to be more divergent , intracellular proteins , such as antiviral proteins , tend to be more conserved , particularly phosphoepitopes . Thus , it is likely that many available antibodies to house mouse ( Mus musculus ) or Norway rat antiviral proteins will be cross - reactive with orthologs from hantavirus rodent reservoir species . Without information as to which proteins may be of interest , screening of antibodies is a daunting and expensive task since most likely will not be informative . However , combined with RNA - Seq and metabolomic data , it is likely that target proteins and pathways can be identified so that investigators can focus their efforts and resources . In addition , software tools can help predict whether antibodies may be cross - reactive to proteins from reservoir hosts [ 109 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 201}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
