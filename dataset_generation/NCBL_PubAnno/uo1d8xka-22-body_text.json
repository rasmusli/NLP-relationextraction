Our analysis of H5N1 NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host . Of course , single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and , hence , we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work . However , even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study . Even with the limited amount of data , we have been able to find a clear pattern ( geographical clustering ) and the importance of glycon sites . However , further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as HA , Polymerase etc . , and also at gene and genome level , are required to draw firm conclusions . It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large . In our experience , zooming onto a cluster of interest ( e . g . Thailand and China clades ) with relative ease and quickness , using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study . Furthermore , the comparison of different algorithms simultaneously with the same input file is another attractive attribute .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
