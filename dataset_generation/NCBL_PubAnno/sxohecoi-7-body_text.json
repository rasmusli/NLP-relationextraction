Although perturbations of normal microbiota , such as occur with bacterial vaginosis , raise the pH , the secretions generally remain in the acidic range [ 26 , 27 ] . Semen rapidly neutralizes cervicovaginal secretions , but the extent of the pH change is variable . For example , a large amount of ejaculate may raise the pH to the neutral range , whereas a small amount may not [ 28 , 29 ] .
