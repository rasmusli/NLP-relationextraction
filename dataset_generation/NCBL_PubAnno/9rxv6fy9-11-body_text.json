For comparison , using a similar experimental arrangement , but using a conventional 254 nm germicidal UVC lamp , McDevitt et al . 19 found a D 95 value of 1 . 1 mJ / cm 2 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 0 - 1 . 2 ) for H1N1 virus . Thus as we 13 , 15 and others [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] reported in earlier studies for bacterial inactivation , 222 - nm far - UVC light and 254 - nm broad - spectrum germicidal light are also comparable in their efficiencies for aerosolized viral inactivation . Other recent work comparing viral inactivation across the UVC spectrum has shown variations in efficiency are expected , but in general both regions of the spectrum are effective in inactivation , though the precise cause of inactivation may differ 20 , 21 . However as discussed above , based on biophysical considerations and in contrast to the known human health safety issues associated with conventional germicidal 254 - nm broad - spectrum UVC light , far - UVC light does not appear to be cytotoxic to exposed human cells and tissues in vitro or in vivo [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
