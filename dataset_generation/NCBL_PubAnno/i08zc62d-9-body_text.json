Crystals grew at 293 K in 2 ml drops comprised of equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution consisting of 20 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 3350 , 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate . The crystals were soaked in soaking solution [ 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6 . 5 , 20 % ( w / v ) PEG 3350 , 10 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 5 mM diplacone , 5 % ( v / v ) dimethyl sulfoxide ] for 2 h at 293 K . The crystals were cryoprotected by transfer into cryoprotectant [ 20 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol 4000 , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate ] and flash - cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection . A complete data set for Cp - NanI CD with diplacone at 1 . 9 \u00c5 resolution was collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q315r detector on beamline 5C at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory ( PAL ) using an X - ray beam with a single wavelength ( 0 . 9795 \u00c5 ) . The crystal belonged to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit - cell parameters a = 69 . 1 , b = 72 . 6 , c = 97 . 1 \u00c5 . Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL - 2000 suite research papers ( Otwinowski & Minor , 1997 ) . The structure of Cp - NanI CD with diplacone was determined using the molecular - replacement method with MOLREP ( Vagin & Teplyakov , 2010 ) in the CCP4 suite using the apo crystal structure of Cp - NanI CD ( PDB entry 2vk5 ; Newstead et al . , 2008 ) as the phasing model . Automated model building and refinement of NanI CD complexed with diplacone were performed with REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al . , 2011 ) in the CCP4 suite and phenix . refine ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) . phenix . ligandfit ( Ter et al . , 2006 ) was used for automated ligand building of the diplacone in Cp - NanI CD , and manual model building was performed with Coot ( Emsley & Cowtan , 2004 ) . Weak electron - density regions ( residues 692 - 694 ) were excluded from the final structure . The Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MolProbity ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . 96 . 2 % of the residues were in the preferred regions and 3 . 8 % of the residues were in allowed regions . A 2F o \u00c0 F c composite OMIT map of diplacone contoured at 1 . 0 was generated with FFT ( Read & Schierbeek , 1988 ) in the CCP4 suite . The atomic coordinates and structure factors of Cp - NanI CD with diplacone have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) with accession code 4l2e . Data - collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
