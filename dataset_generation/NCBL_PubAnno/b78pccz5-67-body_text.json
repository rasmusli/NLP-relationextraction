The radon estimate assumes efficient application and control of radon safe construction in radon - prone areas combined with control of second hand smoke exposures known to act synergistically with radon . Efficient second hand smoke reductions have already been demonstrated in Finland in both workplaces and in homes resulting a decrease in proportion of adolescents exposed to SHS from 17 % in 1991 to 6 % in 2009 [ 25 ] and the SHS policies are moving forward also on at European level . The carbon monoxide controls were aimed to be implemented by compulsory alarms that will allow for identification of malfunctioning devices before the risks occur .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 482, "end": 486}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 538}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
