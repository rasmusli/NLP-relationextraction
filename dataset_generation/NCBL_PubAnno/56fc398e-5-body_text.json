Births , deaths and movements of animals are recorded for individual cattle via the Cattle Tracing System ( CTS ) , and for batches of other livestock via the Animal Movement Licence scheme . Such data have driven the development of sophisticated models to capture and predict the spread of livestock diseases such as FMD [ 1 , 8 , 17 , 18 ] , bovine tuberculosis [ 12 , 19 ] and Escherichia coli [ 20 ] . However , many countries around the world do not routinely collect farm - level data , or they are not readily available for research owing to issues regarding privacy . For example , in the USA , the National Agricultural Statistics Service carries out an agricultural census every 5 years . In order to preserve anonymity for farmers , all data are aggregated at the county level , and therefore precise locations of livestock farms are unknown . Furthermore , movement data are held at the individual state level , and there is no requirement for livestock movements to be recorded unless movements are out of state [ 21 ] . In the UK , the poultry industry infers movements between holdings using targeted sampling of premises based upon their function and size . This method predominantly targets large farms , and therefore does not accurately capture the demographic characteristics of the underlying farm population [ 22 ] . Therefore , it is important to understand the ability of models to predict the potential for disease spread through livestock movements when only a partial sample of the network is available .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 419}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 431}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 473}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
