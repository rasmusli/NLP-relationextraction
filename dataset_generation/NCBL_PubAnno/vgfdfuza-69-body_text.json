The most often mentioned responses were : the need to project AMR costs to draw more attention to the topic ; pushing forward the AMR agenda by fear of no treatment ; creating a community of practice ; considering the social aspects of AMR in order to develop prevention efforts against AMR ; engaging the community and public campaigns on the drivers of AMR ; and increasing vaccination rates in children and adult population . One important step to realizing these strategies would be to have good quality data obtained from standardized surveillance platforms at the national level . This will allow the conduct of outcome research , which can eventually be translated into messages to increase awareness and to push forward the AMR agenda . For example , Naylor et al . used a national mandatory surveillance database in England to quantify the cost and mortality burden of Escherichia coli bacteremia , as well as the influence different resistances have on them . Such findings will be useful for understanding the health and economic impact of future trends in resistance , and for prioritization of funding and strategies to tackle the problem [ 33 ] . In addition , future research could focus on exploring further how the current Singapore National Strategic Action Plan is being implemented ; exploring in more detail the social , political , behavioral and cultural components affecting AMR ; and analyzing at greater length what type of AMR awareness campaigns could be developed to reach the community and engage civil society organizations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 104}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 216}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 390}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 441}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 509}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 882, "end": 886}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1028, "end": 1056}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1549, "end": 1553}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1600, "end": 1604}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
