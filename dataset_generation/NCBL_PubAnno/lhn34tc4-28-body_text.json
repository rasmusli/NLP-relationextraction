Building upon previous theoretical work on the justification for public health intervention [ 25 ] , our model is designed to reflect the dynamic interplay among theory , empirical evidence , and policy / practice that is inherent to public health . To that end , we have incorporated the empirical data from the public opinion survey described in this paper . The model explicitly contemplates the four primary functions of public health as regards the use of restrictive measures in infectous disease outbreaks , namely , response , enforcement , support , and oversight . For instance , with respect to the enforcement of quarantine orders , the model illustrates how the specific function of enforcement aligns with the ethical principle of the ' least restrictive means ' and is likewise concordant with empirical evidence indicating strong public support for the use of sanctions to promote compliance with quarantine orders ( survey data reported here ) . This conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures in public health emergencies should be considered provisional and , as such , is open to further testing and refinement .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 185}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 689, "end": 707}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1240, "end": 1254}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
