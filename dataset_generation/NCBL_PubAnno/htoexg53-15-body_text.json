JX869059 ) . This peptide library was designed to contain 15 - mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa . Eighty - four peptides could be synthesized ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and were organized into two - dimensional matrix peptide pools ( V1 to V9 and H1 to H9 ) containing 9 or 10 peptides as described previously [ 47 , 48 ] . For further T cell epitope mapping , the 11 aa sequence shared between peptide # 89 and # 90 was trimmed into 8 - 10 - mer peptides , which were also obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific . All peptides were dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 2 mg / mL and stored at \u2212 20 \u2022 C until use .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
