Briefly , wells were coated with 250 ng of a gp120 Env specific anti - C5 - antibody ( D7324 [ Aalto Bioscience ] ) , washed and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk . Serial dilutions of detergent - solubilized HIV - 1 JR - FL ( starting at 150 ng p24 ) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 37uC . Plates were then incubated with a constant concentration of antibodies ( 1 mg / mL ) for 1 hour at 37uC followed by detection and development steps as described above .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
