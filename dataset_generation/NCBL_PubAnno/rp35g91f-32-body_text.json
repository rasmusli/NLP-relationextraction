We used the oPOSSUM - 3 Web - based tool ( Kwon et al . 2012 ) to identify overrepresented , conserved transcription factor binding sites in our set of 21 pulmonary myocardium genes and five candidate modifier genes . The pulmonary myocardium gene network was enriched in binding site sequences for SRF ( serum response n", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
