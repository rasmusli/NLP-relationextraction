We conduct simulations of the spread of a novel pathogen out of Mexico using an SIR model whose transmission parameters are informed by epidemiological estimates obtained for pandemic H1N1 [ 31 ] and whose spatial spread is determined by one of four different migration rate models , each defined by a different matrix of movement rates among all pairs of locations ( Methods ) . We measure the relative correspondence between the simulated and observed H1N1 peaks for each location except Mexico using a Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient ( r ) and mean absolute error ( MAE ; in days ) ( Fig . 4 ) . An equal rates model ( A ) , which does not express any migration rate preference , results in a weak match ( r ~ 0 : 11 , P = 0 . 73 , MAE = 40 . 9 days ) between the simulations and the observed spatial spread of H1N1 ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating that the population sizes included in the SIR model for each region offer limited predictive performance . As expected , adding information on the number of airline passengers ( model B ) yields a large improvement in correspondence between simulations and observations ( r ~ 0 : 61 , P = 0 . 03 , MAE = 35 . 8 days ) . In contrast , a standard parameterrich phylogeographic model that is only informed by sequence data and not air traffic information ( model C ) yields only part of this improvement in predictive performance ( r ~ 0 : 47 , P = 0 . 10 , MAE = 39 . 4 days ) . However , if inference under model C is made more efficient by focusing on a small set of parameters ( using BSSVS , [ 21 ] ; see Methods ) then phylogeographic estimates yield a predictive performance ( r ~ 0 : 62 , P = 0 . 02 , MAE = 36 . 4 days , Fig . S5 ) that is close to that of the air travel model ( B ) . Finally , The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E\u00bdd because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor . Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots . The contribution of each predictor , when included in the model ( bDd ~ 1 ) , where b is the coefficient or effect size , is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale . NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the predictor was never included in the model . We tested different population size and density measures , different incidence - based measures and different seasonal measures ( Text S1 ) , but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity . The estimates for the full set of predictors are summarized for each sub - sampled data set in Fig . S5 . NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1003932 . g002 the GLM model ( D ) predicts the observed spread of H1N1 more accurately than all other models ( r ~ 0 : 82 , P , 0 . 01 , MAE = 32 . 3 ) , suggesting that global influenza transmission is best predicted by combining passenger flux data with the information on viral lineage movement contained in sequence data . The simulations generally correspond better with observed H1N1 peaks during the initial period of pandemic expansion , while the epidemic peaks for Russia and Africa occur significantly earlier in the simulations than in reality . This is likely due to the multi - peaked character of the regional epidemics ( Text S1 ) ; the H1N1 virus spreads to most of the world during the first pandemic wave , whereas regions like Russia and Africa appeared to miss the first wave entirely . Seasonal effects that are unaccounted for by our simulation may at least partly explain the outliers , but they affect the models we aim to compare in a very similar way . Because of the outliers , we consider the non - parametric Spearman ' s r to be a more appropriate measure of correspondence than the MAE , but they are consistent in their model ranking . We note that absolute prediction errors can be considerably improved by only considering the 9 air communities that peaked prior to September , 2009 , which returns a MAE of 11 . 2 day for the GLM model . However , because of the difficulties in establishing initial waves and their peaks , and the uncertainty in our epidemiological model , we caution against more detailed interpretation of these simulations beyond the general trends we extract here .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 261}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
