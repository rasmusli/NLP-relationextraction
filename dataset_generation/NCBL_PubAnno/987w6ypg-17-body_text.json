To this end , cells were transfected as above in the presence of a small amount of Gag - GFP , prior to confocal microscopy analysis ( Figure 3A and B ) . As previously reported , all IFITMs were found at the plasma membrane , although more specific patterns could be observed for individual IFITMs ( more prominent intracellular localization of IFITM2 and higher cell membrane distribution of IFITM1 ) . HIV - 1 Gag displayed an heterogeneous and mostly punctuate intracellular localization pattern , as extensively reported by others [ 32 ] and not surprisingly the two signals overlapped at least partially ( Figure 3B , depicts a two - dimensional graph presenting pixel intensities for the cells presented above ) . The degree of reciprocal colocalization between Gag and IFITMs was more carefully quantified by measuring the Manders overlap coefficient ( Figure 3C ) . From 50 to 65 % of IFITMs was found to co - localize with Gag and about 70 % of Gag co - localized with IFITMs , which is overall not surprising in light of the natural intracellular distribution of these proteins . No major relocalization of either IFITMs or Gag was noted upon co - expression , indicating that these proteins are unlikely to influence the trafficking of each other . So , overall this analysis indicates that in light of their natural membrane distribution , IFITMs can find themselves at sites in which HIV - 1 virion particles assembly takes place , providing a reason for their incorporation in HIV - 1 virions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
