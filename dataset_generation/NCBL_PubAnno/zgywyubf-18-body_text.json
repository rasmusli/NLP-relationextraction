As expected , IL - 6 and IL - 8 transcript level was decreased in ORF2 expressing TPA treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd TPA treated cells ( Figure 5D ) . These experiments indicates that ORF2 protein , by virtue of its ability to inhibit NF - \u03baB activity , suppress TPA induced IL - 6 and IL - 8 RNA synthesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
