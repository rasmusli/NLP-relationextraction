Nsp6 induced autophagosomes fused with LAMP1 labelled lysosomes and autophagosomes were susceptible to wortmannin treatment . This indicates that bone fide autophagy was induced . Interestingly , nsp6 homologues from SARS - CoV , MHV and arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) , also induced autophagy .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 451}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 459}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
