A specimen was considered as screening positive if the average of the three wells containing the sera exhibited a > 50 % reduction in luminescence in comparison to the luminescence negative ( BSA ) or no serum control . Thirteen sera ( 9 animal exposed and 4 controls ) screened positive at 1 : 20 , but upon titration of these sera in subsequent assays , none of them were reproducibly able to neutralize the MERS - CoV pseudotyped lentiviral vector at a serum dilution of 1 : 20 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
