Infection typically leads to disseminated infection within a few days but without conspicuous signs of disease . Expression of immune genes can be detected in as little as a few days that suggests innate and adaptive immune activation , but the magnitude of expression is substantially less than in hantavirus pathology models . The lack of reagents and methodologies for studying hantavirus reservoirs , most of which are not model organisms , presents a significant challenge . However , new technologies have recently emerged that are cost effective and species - independent , but which generate large amounts of data that require substantial computational and bioinformatics support for data reduction . With these tools , it should be possible to accelerate research to understand the relationships of hantaviruses and their reservoir hosts . work was provided by the Department of Microbiology , Immunology and Pathology , Colorado State University ( TS ) , NIH grant AI054461 ( TS ) , and Intramural Program of NIAID , NIH ( JP ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 410}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 921}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
