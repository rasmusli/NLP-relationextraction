For bacterial expression , the NanI catalytic domain without the lectin domain ( NanI CD ; residues 243 - 694 ) was amplified from C . perfringens genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET - 23d expression vector ( Novagen ) , which contains a direct C - terminal hexahistidine ( His 6 ) tag . Cp - NanI CD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus ( DE3 ) cells . The transformed cells were cultured in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium containing 100 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K . The bacterial cells were induced at 293 K for 20 h with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( Pharmacia ) at an OD 600 of 0 . 6 and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min . The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM imidazole , 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM - mercaptoethanol ) and lysed by sonication , after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h . The resultant supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal - affinity chromatography on nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid resin ( Peptron ) pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole ) . The column was then washed with ten bed volumes of wash buffer . The His 6 - tag fused protein bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 300 mM imidazole ) . The samples were then purified by size - exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200 column ( GE Healthcare Life Science ) preequilibra with gel - filtration buffer ( 25 mM CHES - HCl pH 9 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl ) , after which the fractions containing Cp - NanI CD protein were collected . The protein was concentrated to 21 . 8 mg ml \u00c01 using an Amicon Ultra - 15 30K ( Millipore ) and was stored at 193 K .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
