Because polyproteins are processed co - and post - translationally by both host and viral proteases , we ran a systematic PubMed search with the terms ' name of the virus C autophagy ' followed by ' name of the virus C LC3 ' to restrain the result outcome as necessary , finally we looked for papers ( excluding reviews and commentaries ) that specifically mention proteins derived from the processing of the viral genome polyprotein .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
