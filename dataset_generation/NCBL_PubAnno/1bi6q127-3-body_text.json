{"cord_uid": "1bi6q127", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6410205", "divid": "3", "text": "Over the past few years , the interest in bat research has increased because of the range of viruses that they harbor and the potential of spillover to humans and other vertebrates [ 1 ] . In some instances , there is direct evidence that viruses have spilled over from bats to other vertebrates . For example , Nipah virus spilled over from bats to humans and pigs leading to outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Hendra virus continues to spillover into horses and humans in Australia [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . In other instances , the evidence of virus spillover from bats is circumstantial . For example , in case of ebolaviruses , serological evidence and the detection of viruses related to the ebolaviruses in bats [ 7 , 8 ] suggests that they are reservoirs of the virus . Recent discoveries of filoviruses in bats of China and Sierra Leone have further bolstered this claim [ 9 , 10 ] . However , viruses linked to specific Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) epidemics have not yet been detected in bats . Although bats harbor many diverse viruses , their spillover to other animals is extremely rare [ 11 ] . One of the reasons is that for a spillover event to take place several factors such as pathogen shedding , environmental conditions , pathogen persistence in environment , and recipient host susceptibility , should all be conducive to transmission . This would result in the \" perfect storm \" required for spillover . A review by Plowright et al . [ 12 ] describes the factors that could lead to such a perfect storm . Here , we focus on one of the initial events affecting this spillover , i . e . , an increase in pathogen shedding .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 416}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 634}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 701, "end": 714}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 953}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 959}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
