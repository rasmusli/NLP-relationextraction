In light of the strong tendency toward natural genetic attenuation which we document here , we suggest that the natural reservoir most likely involves a very quiescent viral state , as might occur within a host where there is very little viral replication , and hence much lower mutation rates . It would be very interesting to know the rate of influenza mutation accumulation in waterfowl .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 586}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
