GMO testing can be performed in steps : routine screening for the presence of GMOs using generic assays such as for 35S promoters and T - nos ; and if required , identification of specific events can be performed using event - specific assays . Equally , direct screening using event - specific assays is also feasible . The levels of sensitivity are orders of magnitude below the permissible threshold for GMO in food and feed ( EC regulation 1830 / 2003 ) , ensuring the detection of the presence of GMOs at acceptable levels and the reliable detection of any presence of unauthorised GM events , for which at present there is no legally acceptable lower limit ( according to EC regulations ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
